                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">What Are IoT-Based Fleet Management and Telematics?</h2>
                            <p>IoT is playing a key role in offering fleet managers, logistics operators, and drivers
                                the ability to make informed, near-real-time decisions. This is possible by collecting
                                and analyzing more data as it is being generated, referred to as processing data at the
                                edge. Network connectivity via IoT-enabled devices that have built-in processor
                                capabilities provides the connection between the vehicle, the cloud, and the fleet
                                manager.</p>
                            <p>For example, edge-enabled IoT telematics solutions can collect, store, and analyze
                                vehicle and roadway condition data from GPS technology, artificial intelligence
                                (AI)–enabled technologies for computer vision, and onboard diagnostics. Providing this
                                data to fleet owners and managers can help them to monitor vehicle maintenance, driver
                                operation, and cargo management.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, once collected, the data can be uploaded to the cloud for both global
                                access and analysis, including trend identification and predictive projections. This
                                level of information visibility can be used to improve operations, manageability, and
                                sustainability.</p>
                            <p>Use cases for IoT-enabled telematics for fleet management include:</p>

                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Unique Challenges and Opportunities for Fleet Management</h2>
                            <p>A large amount of data needs to be collected for optimal fleet management, from fuel
                                consumption, maintenance frequency, and engine diagnostic codes to delivery ETAs,
                                vehicle location and driver performance monitoring information, and in-vehicle passenger
                                count.</p>
                            <p>Traditional telematics solutions for capturing this information included a dongle
                                connected to multiple disparate system devices to capture a limited set of information,
                                including GPS, routing, and fuel consumption data. With multiple independent data sets
                                that had to be collected and aggregated before being analyzed, fleet managers could not
                                get the visibility or information needed for effective decision-making until after the
                                fact. Additionally, each independent point solution and system was vulnerable to
                                potential security risks, and each device required its own power supply.</p>
                            <p>Today, advancements in technology, analytic insights, and AI, along with the increase in
                                e-commerce adoption, are driving digitalization of the fleet. This means transitioning
                                from multiple independent data collection systems to robust single in-vehicle computers
                                that can consolidate data from these disparate systems, process it in near-real time,
                                and transmit it to the cloud for storage and trend analysis.</p>
                            <p>This consolidation of data and the ability to process it all on one device mean these
                                powerful, central in-vehicle computers can monitor more data points and analyze more
                                complex situations more quickly while displaying the results in a single dashboard,
                                including video, road conditions, and cargo management information. Access to this level
                                of advanced telematics enables fleet managers to assist with problem-solving, driver
                                guidance, and decision-making in the moment.</p>
                            <p><b>Preparing for the Future</b></p>
                            <p>The increasing sophistication of consumers, continued obstacles in the wake of the global
                                pandemic, and growing populations in the world’s urban centers will continue to pose
                                significant and meaningful challenges for operators across several industries.</p>
                            <p>Across the world, government leaders at all levels, together with private and public

                                and support climate responsibility will have a direct impact on transportation fleets
                                and drive the need for smarter fleet solutions. Fleets can use funding from these new
                                legislations to digitize, and thereby futureproof, their fleet.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, global urbanization and population growth is projected to increase by 23
                                percent by 2050, adding an estimated additional 2.5 billion people to urban areas during
                                that time1 and doubling the demand for passenger mobility.2 This growth will be
                                accompanied by an increased investment in construction around the globe. In response, <a
                                    href="">cities</a> are similarly integrating IoT and information and communications
                                technology into existing infrastructure to address public safety, traffic congestion,
                                and environmental impact to improve the quality of life for their citizens.</p>
                            <p>The sum of such changes means more data will be available and necessary for
                                decision-making than ever before. Converging IT workloads by combining data inputs into
                                a single in-vehicle dashboard enables fleet managers and drivers to streamline their
                                communications and ability to act on insights.</p>
                            <p>As cities expand, global supply chains become more complex, and commerce increases to
                                meet demand. For example, shipments of US goods are projected to grow by 45 percent by
                                2040.3 Maintaining today’s supply-based economy, with the complexity and diversity of
                                supply chain risks, requires smart management tools for agility in predicting and
                                responding to dynamic marketplace needs.</p>
                            <p>leet operators will need greater flexibility to meet the changing demands of customers
                                and to adapt in near-real time to weather conditions, traffic disruptions, and other
                                events. For fleet managers, using technology, connected devices, and harnessing the
                                power of captured data in an economical way can transform the business. Information
                                based in near-real-time analytics allows organizations to make better decisions,
                                delivering greater value for passengers, customers, and employees.</p>
                            <p>Altogether, modernizing fleet vehicles today will enable seamless integration with the

                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Benefits of IoT-Enabled Fleet Management Systems</h2>
                            <p>IoT for fleet management can help improve cost savings, manageability, and visibility in
                                passenger-load and cargo vehicles. Intel-powered technologies and market-ready partner
                                solutions can capture telematics data across a diverse ﬂeet of vehicle types and models.
                                The latest IoT-enabled telematics benefit not only fleet managers, logistics operators,
                                and drivers but also passengers and end customers through efficient performance and
                                improved customer experiences.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Improved safety.</b>Driver, passenger, and cargo safety can be improved by using
                                    near-real-time computer vision systems inside and around the vehicle. Collected data
                                    may also help to achieve compliance with safety requirements. Vehicle operation and
                                    interaction are supported, as in the case of public bus cameras and back of
                                    semitruck cameras, for inventory loss reduction and risk management. Blind spot
                                    detection technologies can help mitigate collision and accident risks. AI solutions
                                    can detect the presence of people and other vehicles, as well as the proper use of
                                    protective gear on construction sites. Video feeds can be stored for driver coaching
                                    or in case of an accident or litigation. Drivers can also use video to be more aware
                                    of cargo conditions during transit.</li>
                                <li><b>Cost savings and efficiency.</b>When telematics predicts ﬂeet maintenance needs,
                                    managers and operators can proactively service, fix, or replace parts before
                                    problems get more extensive. Optimized route efficiency and cargo utilization
                                    management can help to reduce fuel consumption and idle time. Managers may also see
                                    a decrease in accidents and theft, which can reduce costs associated with vehicle
                                    downtime and repairs or cargo losses. Heavy machine equipment usage can be properly
                                    allocated thanks to waste reduction solutions.</li>
                                <li><b>Expanded connectivityHaving an onboard IoT-enabled device means having options
                                        for powerful, fast, and reliable connectivity, including 5G, Wi-Fi, or Intel
                                        FlexRAN™, a single gateway that supports multiple connectivity options. While
                                        connectivity is not required for all use cases, the in-vehicle capability means
                                        fleet managers have communications and visibility when needed. Onboard
                                        connectivity also enables data analysis to happen in the vehicle, reducing
                                        latency issues so fleet managers can monitor drivers and vehicle usage, make
                                        decisions, give feedback, and provide direction in near-real time. With
                                        passenger-load vehicle fleets, technology allows a more accurate passenger
                                        count, in-vehicle monitoring, streamlined or contactless ticketing systems, and
                                        Wi-Fi access for customers.</b></li>
                                <li><b>Increased sustainability.</b>IoT-enabled, in-vehicle devices can outlive a
                                    specific vehicle and even type of vehicle, as these devices are reusable. This also
                                    increases return on investment over time. Additionally, the consistent monitoring of
                                    fuel consumption helps manage fuel usage, reducing the carbon footprint of the
                                    vehicle.</li>
