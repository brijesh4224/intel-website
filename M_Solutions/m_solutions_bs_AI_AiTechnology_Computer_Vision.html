                        <p class="m_para2">
                            Because computer vision applications are diverse, infrastructure needs vary greatly based on the problem you’re trying to solve, where data is trained and analyzed, and the size of the workload. In this section, we share three key questions to consider as you select the best hardware for your use cases.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="m_subHeading">Consideration 1: Where Will Computer Vision Model Training Happen?</h3>
                        <p class="m_para2">
                            To identify the optimal hardware for your training workload, first consider whether your AI strategy and use case require model training or fine-tuning capabilities at the edge, in the cloud and data center, or both. Cost or security constraints may prevent you from training data in the cloud. Additionally, you may be able to take advantage of off-peak cycles available on your edge servers, allowing you to train where the data is generated.
                        </p>
                        <p class="m_para2">
                            For lightweight training at the edge, such as fine-tuning models, we recommend a server-class <a href=""  class="m_ai_link2"></a>Intel® Xeon® Scalable processor with Intel® Data Center GPUs.
                        </p>
                        <p class="m_para2">
                            For training or deploying large data sets or if you need to train models quickly at the edge, your workload may require additional infrastructure or cloud-based training and inferencing. We recommend considering a distributed training model by pairing AI workloads with on-premises servers. Using multiple <a href=""  class="m_ai_link2"></a>Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors with built-in AI acceleration can unlock efficient and cost-effective training without relying on a GPU.
                        </p>

                            For very large workloads, you can also take an advanced deep learning accelerator approach using <a href=""  class="m_ai_link2"></a>Habana® Gaudi® or discrete data center GPUs such as the <a href=""  class="m_ai_link2"></a>Intel® Data Center GPU Flex 140 or 170.

                            For example, Mobileye applications in autonomous vehicles use computer vision to detect and respond to pedestrians, other vehicles, and traffic signals.
