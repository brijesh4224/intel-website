                            With the help of Intel® technologies, healthcare providers can use edge computing and
                            analytics to convert data into new insights to help improve patient outcomes while
                            delivering financial and operational value.</p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Edge Computing Drives Healthcare Advances</h2>
                        <p>Modern health systems, hospitals, and providers are deploying new tools and building exciting
                            new care models to better serve patients. These strategies focus on clinical decision
                            support (CDS), helping provide clinicians with timely, filtered, and patient-specific
                            information they can use to enhance care.
                        <p>Over the last few years, this pursuit has seen a growing number of medical devices introduced
                            to healthcare environments. These range from tablets and wearables to health monitors and
                            artificial intelligence (AI)-powered imaging systems.</p>
                        <p>Wearables can give clinicians a timely status of key patient vitals such as heart rate and
                            blood pressure, alerting medical staff to issues before they become problems. Health
                            monitors can aid remote care by collecting patient data and triggering actions based on the
                            results—for example, monitoring blood glucose levels and sending that information to a
                            companion device such as an insulin pump to dispense the insulin. AI-powered imaging models
                            can detect potential concerns in X-rays, prioritizing those images for radiologist or
                            physician review.</p>
                        <p>The potential of these emerging innovations is profound, leading to better clinician
                            workflows, lower costs, and improved patient care. But these edge devices have something
                            else in common: they all generate data.</p>
                        <p>As a result, healthcare systems and providers must decide how to manage and make the best use
                            of these unprecedented volumes of data. With bandwidth expense, access, and privacy in mind,
                            what data should be sent to the cloud and what data is better managed locally?</p>
                        <p>Edge computing brings data processing, analytics, and storage closer to the source of data
                            generation—for example, an on-premise server at a hospital or a mobile device at a patient’s
                            home. Edge computing works as a complement to the cloud, allowing IT decision-makers to
                            choose where to best place workloads along the compute spectrum. This strategy can help
                            health systems optimize the collection, storage, and analysis of data—which, for the average
                            hospital, has reached 50 petabytes each year.</p>
                        </p>
                        <p></p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Combining Cloud and Edge Computing</h2>
                        <p>In recent years, health systems and providers largely relied on the cloud for storing,
                            analyzing, and processing data. With help from Intel, the health and life sciences industry
                            is now forging a new data management strategy that strategically employs the cloud or edge
                            computing based on needs, costs, and benefits. For example, it might make sense to limit the
                            transmission of readings from patient wearables to the cloud, sending only summary totals
                            reported at a prescribed interval.</p>
                        <p>Conversely, for systems that capture larger operational or financial data, the cloud will
                            likely remain the preferred path as a means for forecasting organization-wide costs,
                            purchasing and billing schedules, and supply-chain demands.</p>
                        <p>In addition, keeping personal or sensitive data on premise enables health systems and
                            providers to comply with strict data handling and privacy requirements. This includes those
                            outlined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). HIPAA
                            now also includes the Federal privacy protections for individually identifiable health
                            information as mandated by Congress in response to proliferating digital technology.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Intel® Technologies for Edge Computing</h2>
                        <P>With a comprehensive suite of products and technologies, Intel powers edge computing, edge
                            AI, and connectivity from edge to cloud to better capture, analyze, and synthesize health

                            helps simplify the process of getting the right intelligence where it is most needed.</P>

                            MRIs and CT scans, as well as video, such as footage from surgery.</P>
                        <p><a href="">Intel® Virtualization Technology (Intel® VT)</a> represents a portfolio of
                            technologies that make virtualization practical by eliminating performance overheads and
                            helping improve security. With Intel® Virtualization Technology (Intel® VT), multiple
                            applications can run on one server. As a result, health systems and providers can more
                            effectively prioritize critical traffic, reduce the burden on IT, and help lower costs.</p>
                        <p>By enabling analytics and AI from edge to cloud, Intel furthers the healthcare industry’s
                            pursuit of superior CDS, faster diagnoses, and improved patient monitoring and recovery.</p>
