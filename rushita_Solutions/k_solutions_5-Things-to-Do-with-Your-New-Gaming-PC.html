                        <p>One of the most exciting things about getting a new PC, whether you purchased it or built it yourself, is figuring out what to do with it once it’s up and running. Maybe you’d like to overclock your PC and optimize performance, or start playing some competitive games for fun. Having a few goals in mind can really add to your enjoyment of a new system.</p>
                        <p>Below you’ll find some recommendations for exciting things you can do while breaking in your new PC.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-light mt-5 pt-3" id="key2">Try Competitive Gaming</h3>
                        <div class="my-5">
                            <img src="../img/rushita_img/5-thing.avif" alt="" width="100%">
                        </div>
                        <p>Competitive gaming has a number of positives, including increasing your in-game ranking, testing your skills against more difficult opponents, and experiencing a different side to games you might already be familiar with. Once you’ve found a game you want to get better at, there’s a few different ways to start improving.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Practice. </strong>Getting good at competitive gaming starts with climbing the ladder in matchmaking. In order to progress, you’ll have to practice. Game-specific practice tools and training maps can help develop better reflexes, and help you better understand a game’s mechanics.</li>
                            <li><strong>Learn by watching. </strong>While you’re improving your in-game mechanics, watch matches between skilled players or professional teams and try to learn from the higher-level play.</li>
                            <li><strong>Try different peripherals. </strong>Your personal preference will dictate what peripherals work best for you, but consider mice with adjustable DPI (dots per inch), keyboards with mechanical switches, and gaming headsets for communicating with teammates to enhance your gaming experience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Upgrade to a high-refresh rate gaming monitor.</strong> In fast-paced games like <em>Overwatch</em> and <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>, <a href="/content/www/us/en/gaming/resources/everything-you-need-to-know-about-gaming-monitors.html">144Hz and 240Hz monitors</a> can provide a competitive edge over a 60Hz monitor because they display more visual information. They can help improve your reaction times and help you track targets moving across the screen.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>One thing to be aware of: high refresh rate monitors have higher system requirements than 60Hz monitors if you want access to the additional functionality. If your system can’t provide a high enough frame rate, you won’t be able to see the advantages of having a high refresh rate monitor.</p>
                        <p>It’s important to verify that your CPU and GPU are fast enough to provide the frames to your monitor. To play at higher frame rates, the capabilities of your CPU and GPU should be in alignment with the capabilities of your monitor. A high-performance CPU is recommended, along with a GPU of equivalent capabilities. You can learn more about the <a href="/content/www/us/en/gaming/resources/how-cpus-affect-your-gaming-experience.html">impact a CPU has on gaming here</a>.</p>
                        <p>The easiest way to check if your CPU and GPU are capable of supporting high refresh rates for a particular game is by <a href="/content/www/us/en/gaming/resources/read-cpu-benchmarks.html">looking at in-game FPS benchmarks</a>. Look for an average FPS that meets or exceeds the monitor’s refresh rate, and experiment with your in-game settings until you find the performance you’re looking for.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-light mt-5 pt-3" id="key2">Go Live</h3>
                        <p>Live streaming services allow anyone to broadcast their gameplay sessions to the world—or, at the very least, a few close friends. Streaming adds social interactions to your gaming experiences.</p>
                        <p>Setting up a stream is easy. All you need is an internet connection with adequate upload speeds and streaming software such as Open Broadcast Software to help you connect. A mic and webcam are entirely optional, although they can help improve the quality of the stream.</p>
                        <p>When setting up a PC for streaming, it’s important to have the right components—specifically a fast, multi-core processor. Streaming high-definition video while running a game on the same system can put a significant drain on system resources. Without enough cores, the video encoding application and the game will default to competing for resources on the same cores. Both will suffer accordingly.</p>
                        <p>CPUs with high core counts are best for streaming because they can allocate the resources of some cores for gaming while using others to encode the video signal. An Intel® Core™ i7 processor with at least 8GB of RAM is recommended for playing games and streaming at the same time.</p>
                        <p>For everything you need to start streaming, <a href="/content/www/us/en/gaming/resources/how-to-stream.html">check out our full guide</a>.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-light mt-5 pt-3" id="key2">Become a Power User</h3>
                        <p>Few things are more gratifying than having a new system configured exactly how you want it. This also extends to the software you run on your new system. Third-party applications and power-user tweaks allow you to customize the operating system beyond what is offered out of the box. They can make the desktop user experience smoother, sleeker, and more personalized.</p>
                        <p>Here are some ways to spice up the operating environment:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Launch apps with a keystroke.</b> Use a keystroke launcher to quickly open apps and documents from the command line rather than clicking through menus. Ueli and Launchy are two popular options.</li>
                            <li><b>Add flavor to your desktop.</b> Customize the visual presentation of your operating system with sleek, user-created skins. Desktop customization utilities like Rainmeter and Wallpaper Engine allow you to animate wallpapers, modify how information is arranged on the desktop, and add visually compelling weather apps, music visualizers, and system monitors.</li>
                            <li><b>Install all your software in one go.</b> Rather than downloading and installing each application separately, use a software package installer to manage and update all the apps you want on your PC from a single checklist. Chocolatey and Ninite are among the most popular.</li>
                            <li><b>Perform tasks more efficiently.</b> Set up multiple desktops to better organize your workspace. Change button combinations for common tasks like screen grabs and video capture to something you can press without having to look down at the keyboard. Assign frequently used shortcuts to extra mouse buttons.</li>

                            <li><b>Update your drivers. </b>Once your PC is up and running, it’s a good idea to update your Operating System and drivers. This will ensure all devices and hardware are working properly. Much of this process is done automatically when updating your OS, but you may need to download a specialized GPU driver separately. GPU software suites will notify you when a new driver has been released, so you can ensure you’re always up to date. These software suites also come with utilities for optimizing in-game graphics settings, and often include tools that can add to the gaming experience, such as frame rate counters or screen capturing software.</li>
                            <li><b>Keep an eye on system performance.</b> System monitoring apps help ensure your system is running optimally. They can show you the usage, speed, and temperatures of system components. They can tell you how fast the fans are turning and how many are operational. Some give you component specific analysis. The app CPU-Z, for instance, can show you the CPU’s clock speed for each core.</li>

                        <h3 class="fw-light mt-5 pt-3" id="key2">Put Your System to the Test</h3>
                        <p>Benchmarking utilities push your system to the limit. These tough computational challenges slam system components with heavy workloads, scoring them on their ability to perform under pressure. You can use benchmarks to judge the strengths of your PC’s build, and even use them to rank your build against other people’s builds online.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Test your system’s responsiveness. </b>You can do this<b style=""> </b>by simulating your work and leisure environments. PCMark 10, for instance, scores your system on how well it can handle a variety of use cases, from creative workflows to doing a video call while browsing the internet.</li>
                            <li><b>Give your CPU a stress test. </b>Benchmarking tests in <a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/29183/Intel-Extreme-Tuning-Utility-Intel-XTU-">Intel® Extreme Tuning Utility (Intel® XTU)</a> can be run for 5 minutes, or up to 30 days. CINEBENCH is a fully threaded application that rates how quickly multi-core CPUs can complete large rendering tasks. Handbrake plays a high-resolution video file and scores your processor on how fast it can decode it.</li>
                            <li><b>Rank graphical performance.</b> GPU-centric benchmark tests rate your PC’s ability to create complex 3D environments. Heaven Benchmark is a long-standing test for weighing gaming performance.</li>

                        <h3 class="fw-light mt-5 pt-3" id="key2">In-Game Benchmarks</h3>
                        <p>One reason you might want to run benchmarks is to know which games you can play, and what FPS you can reach when playing. Many games (such as <i>Civilization VI</i>, <i>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</i>, and <i>Horizon Zero Dawn</i>) have benchmarking tests built in, and will give you a sense of how well your system can run the game.</p>
                        <p>Another way to run benchmarks is by playing games and seeing how well they perform. Frame rate monitoring tools like Fraps actively display your FPS in the corner of the screen while you play, and can be used to measure your average frame rate in specific sections of the game, or over an entire play session.</p>
                        <p>Just keep in mind that no two games are created equal. In-game performance will fluctuate depending on the specific demands of the game you are playing.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-light mt-5 pt-3" id="key2">HDR Technologies</h3>
                        <p>What is HDR, anyway? At a base level, HDR monitors offer improved contrast ratio — that is, the distinction between bright and dark areas of an image. They utilize increased brightness and deeper black levels to help produce the higher contrast images.</p>
                        <p>In addition to improved brightness and darkness, HDR monitors often include improved color technologies. Monitors with increased bit depth, such as 10-bit color support, can display a higher number of colors for smoother transitions between hues.</p>
                        <p>Increased bit depth also improves color rendering to more faithfully reproduce the effects of light on colors.</p>
                        <p>Monitors with a wider color space, or gamut, meanwhile, are capable of producing more vivid and colorful images.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-light mt-5 pt-3" id="key3">HDR Setup</h3>
                        <p>HDR lighting and color technologies simply make games look better. In order to start gaming in HDR, you’ll need three things:</p>
                        <ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
                            <li>A game with HDR support</li>
                            <li>A computer with a processor and graphics card capable of running HDR content</li>
                            <li>An<b> </b>HDR monitor</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h3 class="fw-light mt-5 pt-3">HDR Games</h3>
                        <p>A game must have native support for HDR to reap the benefits of an<strong> </strong>HDR gaming monitor. The majority of games released prior to 2017 won’t have HDR support. However, the library has been steadily growing since then. Games that support HDR<sup>3</sup> include Far Cry 5, Destiny 2, Battlefield 5, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, and Metro Exodus, to name a few.</p>
                        <p><strong>HDR System</strong></p>
                        <p>Your system should be up to the task. Hardware requirements for HDR video output are relatively modest, and HDR-enabled components are commonly found in recent PCs. A system with the following hardware is capable of supporting a 4K HDR monitor:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A 7th Generation Intel® Core™ processor or better<sup>4</sup></li>
                            <li>An Nvidia* GTX 10 series, Nvidia* RTX 20 Series, or an AMD* Radeon 5 series video card, or better</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>While watching HDR content does not necessarily require a powerful system, gaming in HDR will place more demands on your system. Those demands will be even higher for ultrawides and monitors with higher resolutions such as 1440p or 4K.</p>
                        <p><strong>HDR Monitor</strong></p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">First and foremost, an HDR gaming monitor should be able to provide the sort of refresh rate and response time you like for the games you play. (For additional guidance, read more about monitor technology <a href="../rushita_Solutions/k_solutions_Industries_Intel-in-Esports_Guide-to-Gaming-Monitors.html">here</a>.) Many HDR monitors on the market use ISP panels with slower response times and lower refresh rates than TN panels traditionally used for gaming monitors, so look for an HDR monitor specifically designed for gaming. HDR monitors with 144Hz refresh rates and 4ms response times are available, but cost more.</p>
                        <p>An HDR monitor should support an HDR format, which includes HDR10, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, and HLG. These are video encoding standards used to compress and decompress the video file, and they offer various advantages over one another.</p>
                        <p>Keep in mind that encoding standards can be misleading. A monitor that indicates support for HDR10, HDR10+, DV, or HLG input doesn’t by itself indicate the monitor’s level of capability or actual performance, only that it can successfully decode the HDR content into a video signal. A screen actually needs to be capable of displaying the HDR content, which is where many displays advertised as HDR-ready fall short of the mark.</p>
                        <p>Pro-tip: Since most HDR games support the HDR10 format, look for a monitor that supports HDR10.</p>
                        <p>In addition to looking for a monitor that can receive an HDR signal, look for one with the appropriate hardware capabilities. For HDR output, a monitor should have the following hardware specs:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Peak Brightness: 400 cd/m², or preferably higher</li>
                            <li>Black levels (pixel pitch): 0.40 mm, or lower</li>
                            <li>Color depth: 10-bit (8+2-bit)</li>
                            <li class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1"><a href="../rushita_Solutions/k_solutions_Industries_Intel-in-Esports_Guide-to-Gaming-Monitors.html">Color space</a>: 90% DCI-P3 coverage, or greater</li>
                            <li>Backlight local dimming</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="fw-light mt-5 pt-3" id="key4">VESA Display Standards</h3>
                        <p>The easiest way to determine if a monitor is capable of true HDR output is to look for the VESA* DisplayHDR logo. This logo confirms the monitor’s specs have been tested and verified by the VESA Display HDR program, the only global, open standard for HDR. The program was created to help bring some consistency to the wildly varying specs in HDR monitors appearing on the market.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">The program rates <a href="../rushita_Solutions/k_solutions_Industries_Intel-in-Esports_Guide-to-Gaming-Monitors.html">HDR monitors in seven tiers</a>. These tiers are largely defined by their peak brightness level, but also have requirements for local dimming, color depth, and color gamut. A monitor in the first tier — DisplayHDR 400 — has met the minimum specifications required to display HDR content, while a monitor with higher tier certification will have better HDR capabilities.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-light mt-5 pt-3" id="key5">Peak Brightness</h3>
                        <p>Peak brightness allows for small, highlighted areas of an image to be brightened without affecting the surrounding areas. For instance, individual stars could be brightened while the surrounding night sky remains pitch black.</p>
                        <p>A monitor with 600 cd/m² peak brightness — a measure of how much light can be emitted by the screen — should be considered a minimum for true HDR output. Most entry-level HDR monitors have a brightness level of 400 cd/m². They are a step up from SDR monitors, which typically have a brightness rating of 250 to 350 cd/m², but lack “local dimming zones,” a key feature of quality HDR monitors.</p>
                        <p>Local dimming allows the monitor’s backlight to dim the screen at individual zones, thereby improving the contrast between darkness and lightness in an image. It’s not always obvious if a monitor offers local dimming support, but it should be listed in the specifications if it does.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-light mt-5 pt-3" id="key6">Color Depth</h3>
                        <p>Although misleading, a monitor with 8+2-bit color depth is not a deal breaker. Almost every HDR monitor uses an 8-bit panel with 2 bits worth of dithering to approximate the higher color counts of true 10-bit color depth. These panels are called 8+2-bit panels.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Although 8+2-bit panels are often marketed as 10-bit panels, they are not in the same league with true 10-bit panels, which currently cost double or triple the price. That said, 8+2-bit monitors are a distinct step up from SDR monitors, which typically use 6+2-bit panels.

                        <h3 class="fw-light mt-5 pt-3">Outro: A True HDR Gaming Experience</h3>
                        <p>With vivid brightness, inky blacks, and swarms of colors, an HDR gaming monitor can push the visuals of games further that any SDR monitor, but only if it has the right set of features and specifications. Make sure that your HDR monitor can deliver a true HDR experience.</p>
