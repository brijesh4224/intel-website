                        <p>Diving into video editing for the first time? Trying to figure out which is the best laptop
                            for video editing? Here's some advice. Don't begin with the laptop, begin with you.</p>
                        <p class="my-3">Before you even start looking into microprocessor clock speeds, internal vs.
                            external memory, and all the other specifications with which you can compare one laptop to
                            another. Analyze

                        <h2 class="fs-4 my-3">What Do You Really Need?</h2>
                        <p class="mb-2">
                            You should think about your upcoming video editing projects first for one simple reason:
                            Cost. Higher-end specifications, such as high-resolution screens, fast processing speeds,
                            and larger memory capacity may be preferable, but they are also more expensive. If you think
                            ahead, you can buy what you need now and plan for future expansion. Here are some specific
                            areas to consider:
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-2"> <em><strong>Your content. </strong></em>Your laptop choice will be heavily
                            influenced by the video you want to produce. For example, if you're making social videos to
                            promote your business, you'll want the ability to create text overlay on some clips.
                            Sophisticated audio editing capabilities and good speakers will make a big difference when
                            editing footage from your band's latest gig. Art projects, on the other hand, place a
                            premium on accurate color representation at high resolution.</p>
                        <p class="mb-2"> <em><strong>How you plan to work. </strong></em>Will you be working under time
                            pressures? Then speed matters most. If you're constantly on the road, you may find weight
                            and battery life to be more important.</p>
                        <p class="mb-2"> <em><strong>External gear. </strong></em>External gear, such as a monitor,
                            input device, or extra storage, has to plug into your video editing laptop. You have to make
                            sure your choice has the right kind—e.g., HDMI—and number of inputs.</p>
                        <p> <em><strong>Software. </strong></em>Your editing experience depends on matching the software
                            you need to the hardware it requires. Not all software runs on all laptops. Consider your
                            video editing software preferences before you've made any hardware choices.</p>

                        <h2 class="fs-4 my-3">Navigating Specifications</h2>
                        <p class=" mb-2">
                            With your needs in hand, you can start shopping. You'll face a bewildering array of
                            specifications. The tests used to create these specifications are not only complicated, but
                            often controversial. Finding the best laptop for video editing isn't about specs; it's about
                            fit. Keep that in mind as you peruse the specs.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-2"><em>Processor</em></p>
                        <p class="mb-2">
                            Speed is your friend when it comes to processors for video editing. Figuring out what is
                            actually fastest is not as simple as comparing the 0-60 times for cars. Deciding which
                            processor is best means deciphering how much processor design matters to your work. Do you
                            need a six core? A quad core? Or will a dual core meet your needs? What about
                            hyper-threading? Even if you don't want to get into that level of detail, here's easy
                            shorthand to follow: The higher the processor clock rate in any given processor family, the
                            better. Right now, the clock rate for top candidates ranges from roughly 2.8 GHz to 3.6 GHz,
                            but the numbers change on a regular basis.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-2"><em>RAM (Random Access Memory)</em></p>
                        <p class="mb-2">
                            RAM is important because it's the place where your CPU goes to get the data it uses to make
                            your video edits. The faster that data exchange happens, the faster you can edit. Most
                            experts agree that you need a minimum of 12 GB, and 16 GB is better. Also, there are three
                            types of RAM—SDRAM, DDR, and DRAM. SDRAM is the oldest technology, and it <em>will</em> slow
                            you down. Finally, systems may have one, two, or three channels connecting RAM to the CPU.
                            Three is obviously the fastest, but tests related to gaming (which has similar challenges to
                            editing) indicate that the number of channels doesn't have a big effect. And again, the
                            sheer amount of RAM far outweighs other considerations.
                        </p>
                        <p class="k_text my-3">
                            <a href="#">Learn more about computer RAM ></a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-2">One caveat. Don't assume you'll be able to upgrade the amount of RAM down the
                            road. Some laptops allow this, but some don't.</p>
                        <p class="mb-2"><em>Graphics Card</em></p>

                        <p class="mb-2">Unless you're planning to do only very low-end video editing, you'll want a
                            laptop with a graphics card. For technical reasons, systems for even mid-level editing
                            offload graphics processing from <a href="#" class="k_plink">the CPU to a graphics card with
                                a GPU</a> (graphics processing unit). You should avoid any laptop that doesn't take this
                            approach. It will be too slow. Beyond that, be aware that some video editing software
                            programs recommend (or even require) a specific graphics card or range of cards within a
                            brand, and some graphics cards are only compatible with certain CPUs. It pays to check this
                            out.</p>


                        <p class="mb-2">The key top-level specifications for graphics cards are GPU clock speed and
                            frames per second (FPS) per dollar. However, graphics cards are very complicated and these
                            specs need to be taken in context of the whole laptop. For example, a slow CPU will bog down
                            any graphics card, no matter how fast that card may be.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2"><em>Ports</em></p>
                        <p class="mb-2">Laptops for video editing vary significantly in the number and types of ports
                            they have for external devices like a monitor or a hard drive. It is very important to think
                            ahead about what items you'll need or may need down the road, because if there's no port for
                            them, you're out of luck.</p>
                        <p class="mb-2"><em>Audio</em></p>

                        <p class="mb2">If your content involves music or important ambient sound, accurately hearing
                            what you've got is obviously important. The speakers in some laptops are dramatically better
                            than others. You don't need specifications to evaluate them; your ears will do just fine.
                            Many editors prefer to listen with headphones, which are nearly always superior to laptop
                            speakers. For videos where audio is primary, consider adding external reference speakers.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-2"><em>Storage</em></p>
                        <p class="mb-2">As a rule of thumb, you'll need about twice as much hard drive capacity as the
                            size of your source file—even three times more if you're doing anything fancy, like lots of
                            special effects. But don't forget, you not only need to store source files for editing, you
                            have to store the finished video as well. Video files take up a lot of room; 500 GB is
                            probably the minimum, and 1 TB is an even safer bet..</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">Luckily, you don't have to depend solely on the storage available inside your
                            laptop. External hard drives can help maximize storage capacity while keeping costs in line.
                            For the hard drive itself, you can choose between standard hard drives (HDD) with spinning
                            discs, and <a href="#" class="k_plink">solid state drives</a> (SSD), which are faster and
                            have no moving parts. SSDs, however, are more expensive. A hybrid solution can give you the
                            best of both worlds: A fast onboard SSD to handle working files with and a large external
                            HDD for storage.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">There are three types of LCD panels, and the type you choose makes a big
                            difference.</p>

                            <li>IPS (In-Plane Switching) panels are the preferable choice</li>

                        <p class="mb-2"><em>Resolution</em></p>
                        <p class="mb-2">Resolution is a fairly straightforward specification with several levels
                            available, all defined by the width by height (WxH) in pixels. The most common are:</p>
                        <ul class="mb-2 k_list">
                            <li>High Definition: 1920x1080. This is also known as full high definition (FHD) or 1080p
                            </li>
                            <li>Apple Retina*: 2880x1800</li>
                            <li>4K: 3840x2160. This is sometimes referred to as Ultra High Definition or UDF</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="mb-2">The majority of laptops have much lower resolution than the 1920x1080 that most
                            videographers would agree is the low end of acceptability.</p>
                        <p class="mb-2"><em>Color Fidelity</em></p>
                        <p class="mb-2">There are several scientific definitions of the “color space” offered by laptop
                            screens, but it's easiest to think of it this way: The color space is the number of
                            different colors a monitor can display. The most common is sRGB, (standard Red, Green, Blue)
                            although Adobe RGB* runs a close second. Manufacturers often express color fidelity as a
                            percentage of sRGB, and it's usually over 100% because sRGB doesn't cover all the colors the

                            get bigger. With 4K cameras becoming more common, and virtual reality on the way, when it
                            comes to capacity and processing power, today's luxury will be tomorrow's necessity.</p>
