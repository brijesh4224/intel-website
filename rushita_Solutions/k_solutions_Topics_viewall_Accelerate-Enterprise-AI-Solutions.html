                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5">Overcome the Challenges of AI Deployment</h3>
                        <p>Enterprise organizations are racing to be among the first to deploy new, AI-enhanced capabilities that will help them stand out from the competition, maximize profitability and efficiency, and enhance their customer experience.</p>
                        <p>But as many solution architects, developers, and tech leaders are discovering, taking an enterprise AI project from proof of concept to production is no easy task. Enterprises face challenges throughout their journey—including building scalable, right-sized AI infrastructure, protecting privacy and security, and optimizing solution development time.</p>
                        <p>To help you solve these challenges and steer clear of other emerging AI pitfalls, this article shares essential considerations, insights, and tips for building enterprise AI solutions. We’ll also spotlight some of the Intel® hardware and software that can help enhance your results.</p>
                        <p>Whether you’re building from the ground up, creating a solution from prebuilt components, or purchasing a ready-made offering, here’s how you can streamline your enterprise AI efforts.</p>

                      

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5">Don’t Invest in Specialized Hardware If You Don’t Need To</h3>
                        <p>Among many technologists, there’s a misconception that AI workloads require a GPU or specialized discrete AI accelerator. Simply put, this isn’t true. This mistaken belief can lead organizations to assume they need to make a sizable hardware investment to enable AI, and they deem AI initiatives too costly for their business.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue">For example, <a href="#">classical machine learning</a>&nbsp;workloads do not typically see much benefit from a discrete accelerator, making CPUs a highly efficient choice for algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and linear regression.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Before investing energy and resources in advanced equipment such as GPUs (including licenses), be sure to investigate what your workload actually demands. You may be able to support AI workloads in the data center and at the edge using <a href="#">Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors</a>. These processors come equipped with <a href="#">built-in AI engines</a>&nbsp;that allow you to greatly accelerate AI workloads, both training and inference.</p>
                        <p>Two AI engines included in Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors allow you to deliver strong AI performance using a CPU-only architecture:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1"><a href="#">Intel® Advanced Matrix Extensions (Intel® AMX)</a>: Maximize performance for deep learning training and inference workloads that rely on matrix math, including natural language processing, recommendation systems, and image recognition.</li>
                            <li class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1"><a href="#">Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel® AVX-512)</a>:&nbsp;Accelerate AI, analytics, scientific simulations, financial simulations, and other compute-intensive tasks that involve vector-based computations.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Running AI workloads solely on Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors can help enterprises save on hardware costs while improving energy efficiency. At the same time, developers benefit by avoiding the complexity of specialized hardware and minimizing the need for code or application changes. Your organization is likely already invested in Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors, making adopting them for AI an easier choice.</p>
                        <p>While Intel offers a full range of extreme-performance AI solutions, we suggest most companies start with Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors. They can be used from edge to cloud to help maximize your enterprise AI efforts.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Intel is also working with major enterprise infrastructure platform providers such as <a href="#">RedHat</a>&nbsp;and <a href="#">VMware</a>&nbsp;to maximize AI flexibility and efficiency while accelerating performance from edge to cloud.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5">For Demanding Workloads, Think beyond the H100</h3>
                        <p>While Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors can handle low- and medium-complexity tasks, your use case may involve demanding workloads that require an additional layer of specialized hardware. If your AI use case is demanding, you’ll face the need for a powerful discrete accelerator, often in the form of either a GPU or a purpose-built AI processor.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Of course, performance and efficiency are the name of the game here, and Intel® technologies offer a strong advantage compared to our competitors. For example, <a href="#">Intel® Gaudi 3 AI accelerators</a>&nbsp;deliver:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1.5x faster time to train than NV H100 on average<sup>1</sup></li>
                            <li>1.5x faster inference than NV H100 on average<sup>2</sup></li>
                            <li>1.4x higher inference power efficiency than NV H100 on average<sup>3</sup></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">You can review in-depth performance statistics for Intel® AI data center products <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
                        

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5">Software Tools Are Your AI Secret Weapon</h3>
                        <p>Whether you’re building an AI solution from the ground up or hoping to create a solution leveraging a set of prebuilt elements, you’re likely aware that the software development and model training elements of AI are just as important as hardware. This is especially important as you strive to support the heterogeneous architectures that most enterprise AI initiatives will involve.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">To help you accelerate time to value, Intel offers a broad portfolio of purpose-built software tools, reference kits,&nbsp;optimized frameworks and libraries, and prebuilt solution elements. Using our <a href="#">AI development resources</a>,&nbsp;you can enhance developer productivity, optimize performance, and increase deployment flexibility for your AI capabilities.</p>
                        <p>We offer a range of tools that can have a major impact on your enterprise AI initiative, including:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5">Customize a Foundational Model to Accelerate Your Initiative</h3>
                        <p>Every AI use case is unique, and many will require some degree of model training. The good news is that you don’t need to start from scratch.</p>
                        <p>Open source models, also known as foundational models, provide a starting point for your AI capabilities. These models can be customized and fine-tuned to fit the specific needs of your AI solution. Overall, the process of fine-tuning a foundational model is simpler and faster than building from scratch. The fine-tuning approach can save you valuable time as you race against the competition.</p>
                        <p>Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors are a great platform for model fine-tuning, allowing AI developers to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Achieve up to 10x higher PyTorch real-time inference and training performance with built-in Intel® Advanced Matrix Extension (Intel® AMX) accelerators<sup>4</sup>.</li>
                            <li>Fine-tune a natural language processing (NLP) model, such as DistilBERT, in less than four minutes, which can reduce or eliminate the need for a dedicated accelerator.<sup>5</sup></li>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5">Expedite Generative AI Model Customization with Retrieval-Augmented Generation</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Those pursuing generative AI applications can also take advantage of <a href="#">RAG</a>&nbsp;to realize a faster path to value from AI.</p>
                        <p>In the RAG methodology, foundational large language models are connected to knowledge bases—often company-specific, proprietary data—to inject relevant context and information. Taking this approach, you can achieve customized AI capabilities while avoiding the need for additional model training, which can reduce your initiative’s overall costs and complexity.</p>
