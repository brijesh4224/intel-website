                        <h2 style="margin-top: 5rem;" class="fw-lighter">The Need for Cost-Efficiency and Optimal
                            Resources Utilization in the Cloud</h2>
                        <p>When harnessing cloud infrastructure, one of the primary challenges that HCLTech faces
                            pertains to striking the right balance between performance, uptime, and cost efficiency:
                            what to buy (family), how much to buy (size), and how to ensure the optimal features that
                            will allow specific workloads to perform and scale cost effectively in the cloud (features).
                            Achieving this balance hinges on identifying and implementing the optimal features that
                            enable specific workloads to operate efficiently and scale affordably within the cloud
                            environment.</p>
                        <p>This entails navigating complexities such as selecting the appropriate cloud instance types,
                            configuring resource allocations, and optimizing workload distribution to meet performance
                            requirements while minimizing costs. These important factors are impossible for the
                            workforce to determine optimally using manual or estimation methods. </p>
                        <p>HCLTech utilizes cloud instances from multiple cloud service providers (CSPs), such as AWS,
                            Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and these major CSPs provide onboarding
                            and optimization services at no cost. However, these services and analyses often have
                            limitations. They primarily focus on purchase plans and billing optimizations, offering
                            tooling that is not tailored to individual needs, lack granular controls, provide basic
                            analytics, and fail to clarify the rationale behind conclusions. HCLTech needed analytics
                            with the necessary rigor to yield accurate answers and eliminate guesswork, to ensure that
                            they can optimally select the appropriate cloud instances for specific workloads, which in
                            turn can result in significant cost savings.</p>

                        <h2 style="margin-top: 5rem;" class="fw-lighter">The Process Behind the Optimization</h2>
                        <p>For HCLTech, it was just a simple process of simply inputting their CSP cloud credentials,
                            which allows Intel Cloud Optimizer to ingest up to two months of workload history maintained
                            by the CSP for all identified cloud instances. And for a continuous optimizing process, the
                            optimizer stores and maintains up to 90 days of workload history to further learn from and
                            refine its recommendations. Apart from just leveraging workload history to analyze CSP
                            instance usage, the optimizer utilizes additional technical or business constraints and
                            flags to ensure that answers are truly “fit for purpose” and actionable.
                        </p>
                        <p>The optimizer uses proprietary analytics models to learn from resource usage patterns and
                            builds a profile for each workload across compute instances and then recommend an ideal
                            instance type for each workload. These recommendations are actionable because they include
                            all the required considerations as well as actual detailed workload behaviors, enabling
                            HCLTech to confidently take action and switch to the recommended instance type to help
