                                        <p class="V_pv pt-1">RAM’s purpose is to store the short term data that a PC
                                            requires to properly operate. But unlike a hard disc drive or SSD
                                            (solid-state drive), which store data indefinitely, RAM resets every time
                                            the system is rebooted.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv pt-1">RAM is “volatile memory,” meaning it only stores data when
                                            it has power, as opposed to a “non-volatile” HDD or SSD. Programs are loaded
                                            into RAM temporarily while in use, but reside on a storage drive permanently
                                            (until deleted).
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv pt-1">Computers need quick access to temporary data in order to
                                            run programs or execute tasks. Modern PC games, for example, need to rapidly
                                            retrieve art assets. Games read and write data to RAM because it’s orders of
                                            magnitudes faster than accessing data on a storage device.

                                        should ensure RAM is compatible with your motherboard and processor. The wrong
                                        type of modules simply won’t work, while RAM with the wrong specs for your PC
                                        can underperform.</p>
                                    <p class="V_pv"><strong>Module Type</strong></p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">RAM comes in sticks, or memory modules, that snap into the
                                        memory slots on the motherboard. RAM that’s incompatible with your system either
                                        won’t fit, or won’t function properly.</p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">Motherboards in modern computers support DDR4 RAM. DDR4
                                        shouldn’t be confused with DDR3, the previous generation of SDRAM. They’re not
                                        interchangeable, and you can’t replace (for example) 8GB of DDR3 with 16GB of
                                        DDR4.</p>
                                    <p class="V_pv"><strong>DDR4 and SDRAM</strong></p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">Computers use a type of RAM called SDRAM (Synchronous
                                        Dynamic Random Access Memory). “Synchronous” DRAM is synchronized with the
                                        frequency of the processor. SDRAM has improved over time, offering benefits like
                                        lower power consumption, faster transfer rates, and more stable data
                                        transmission.</p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">DDR4 SDRAM is the current standard for modern-day
                                        computers. DDR4 stands for “Double Data Rate 4,” and is the fourth generation of
                                        DDR technology, which replaced SDR (Single Data Rate) SDRAM. DDR4 features
                                        faster data transfer rates, larger capacities, and lower voltages than the
                                        previous generation.</p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">If you’re building a new PC or upgrading RAM in a
                                        relatively recent system, you’ll probably be dealing with the current standard
                                        of DDR4 SDRAM.</p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">Why isn’t DDR4 backwards compatible? Because it has
                                        different timings (see below), voltage, and pin count, among other
                                        characteristics. To prevent accidental installation, the key notch on DDR4

                                            <p class="V_pv">RAM timings are a measure of latency, or the delay before
                                                RAM can execute the commands it’s been given. Memory timings are given
                                                as a set of numbers, such as 16-18-18-36, which may be seen on the
                                                module’s factory sticker.

                                            <p class="V_pv ">Each number corresponds to a specific test. The first
                                                number, for example, is CAS (Column Address Strobe) Latency—the number
                                                of clock cycles it takes for the memory module to return a set of data
                                                after a request from the memory controller.</p>
                                            <p class="V_pv">Comparing RAM modules based on timings can be complicated.
                                                For instance, CAS Latency only states the total number of cycles; the
                                                duration of each cycle also matters when judging responsiveness. For
                                                example, DDR3 memory usually has a lower CAS Latency than DDR4, but
                                                performs worse due to its slower clock speed.

                                                for a gaming PC. Timings are of interest to overclockers, who can
                                                manually lower timings in the BIOS, then test for stability. If
                                                successful, you can get better performance out of your existing RAM.</p>
