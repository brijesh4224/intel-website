                            <p>Intel recognizes that in many of the locations where we operate, employees have the right
                                to freely associate or not associate with third-party organizations, such as labor
                                organizations, along with the right to bargain or not bargain collectively in accordance
                                with local laws. Intel respects those rights and is further committed to treating our
                                employees with dignity and respect, and creating an environment of open communication
                                where employees can speak with their managers about their ideas, concerns or problems,
                                and team together to address workplace issues. We encourage our employees to share their
                                ideas, concerns, or suggestions through an environment of cooperation and teamwork.</p>

                            <p>While we do not always know nor can we control what products our customers create or the
                                applications end-users may develop, Intel does not support or tolerate our products
                                being used to adversely impact human rights. We evaluate potential concerns and
                                implement a “High Confidence Standard” to prevent and mitigate product misuse. Where we
                                become aware of a concern that Intel products are being used by a business partner in
                                connection with abuses of human rights, we will restrict or cease business with the
                                third party unless and until we have a high confidence that Intel's products are not
                                being used to adversely impact human rights.</p>

                                to conduct human rights impact assessments (HRIAs), review our processes, and validate
                                our human rights risks across the enterprise. The output of this work is Intel’s Human

The Human Rights program is managed by the Corporate Responsibility Office and directed by a cross-Intel Human Rights Steering Committee, a global team that develops and implements policies and actions related to our human rights risks across all aspects of the business. The Intel Board of Directors’ Corporate Governance and Nominating (CGN) Committee has primary responsibility for oversight of corporate responsibility—including human rights issues—at Intel. Management provides formal updates to the CGN Committee at least twice each year and at least annually to the full Board on the company's corporate responsibility performance and disclosure.&nbsp;</p>

All employees are expected to complete training on the Code of Conduct when they join the company and annually thereafter. We offer a holistic human rights training course for employees to help raise their awareness about Intel's initiatives and ways they can act in their roles to advance our human rights strategy. This training is in addition to role-specific training that employees with direct responsibility for supply chain management, for example, receive with respect to mitigating Human Rights risks within our supply chain.</p>
