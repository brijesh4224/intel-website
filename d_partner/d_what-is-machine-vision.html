                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">What Is Machine Vision?</h2>
                            <p>Simply put, machine vision technology gives industrial equipment the ability to “see”
                                what it
                                is doing and make rapid decisions based on what it sees. The most common uses of machine
                                vision are visual inspection and defect detection, positioning and measuring parts, and
                                identifying, sorting, and tracking products.</p>
                            <p>Machine vision is one of the founding technologies of industrial automation. It has
                                helped
                                improve product quality, speed production, and optimize manufacturing and logistics for
                                decades. Now this proven technology is merging with artificial intelligence and leading
                                the
                                transition to Industry 4.0.</p>
                            <p><i>Machine vision is a primary component of industrial automation. Explore the diagram
                                    above
                                    to learn how machine vision system components work together to transform
                                    operations.</i>
                            </p>
                            <p></p>
                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">How It All Started: Classic Machine Vision Systems</h2>
                            <p>Machines could “see” before AI and machine learning. In the early 1970s, computers began
                                using specific algorithms to process images and recognize basic features. This classic
                                machine vision technology can detect object edges for positioning a part, find color
                                differences that indicate a defect, and discern blobs of connected pixels that indicate
                                a
                                hole.</p>
                            <p>Classic machine vision involves relatively simple operations that don’t require
                                artificial
                                intelligence. Text has to be simple and sharp, like a bar code. Shapes have to be
                                predictable and fit an exact pattern. A classic machine vision system can’t read
                                handwriting, decipher a wrinkled label, or tell an apple from an orange.
                            <p>Nevertheless, classic machine vision has had a huge impact on manufacturing. Machines
                                don’t
                                get tired, so they can spot defects faster and more reliably than human eyes. Plus,
                                machines
                                aren’t bound by the limits of human vision. Specialized machine vision cameras can use
                                thermal imaging to detect heat anomalies and X-rays to spot microscopic flaws and metal
                                fatigue.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">The Rise of Artificial Intelligence: Deep Learning Inference and
                                Industrial Machine Vision</h2>
                            <p>Increasingly powerful <a href="">edge computing</a> —embedded and IoT devices at the
                                network
                                edge and beyond—plus a growing universe of deep learning models for artificial
                                intelligence
                                (AI) are radically expanding what machine vision can do. This rapid growth in
                                capabilities
                                is leading the transformation to smart factories and Industry 4.0.</p>
                            <p>AI augments classic computer vision algorithms with models called neural networks. When a
                                computer receives an image, or a video stream of images, machine vision software
                                compares
                                that image data with a neural network model. This process, called deep learning
                                inference,
                                allows computers to recognize very subtle differences like minuscule pattern mismatches
                                in
                                fabric and microscopic flaws in circuit boards.</p>
                            <p>To improve accuracy and speed, data scientists create specific neural network models for
                                specific applications. During this process, called supervised training, a computer
                                reviews
                                tens of thousands of samples and identifies meaningful patterns, including patterns a
                                human
                                might not detect.</p>
                            <p>There are models for detecting dead and off-color pixels in displays, seeing voids in
                                welds,
                                and pinpointing pulled threads in fabric. Of course, more models are constantly being
                                developed and refined.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Smart Machine Vision and Autonomous Systems</h2>
                            <p>Artificial intelligence is expanding machine vision far beyond visual inspection and

                            <p>Industrial machine vision is the backbone of smart manufacturing, logistics, and
                                operations.
                                Machine vision cameras, embedded IoT sensors, and industrial PCs can bring intelligence,
                                analysis, and efficiency to every step of the manufacturing process.</p>

                                and
                                freeing up your staff to focus on higher-value work.</p>

                                resulted in an increase in the number of welds analyzed per day, reduced labor costs in
                                their factories, and allowed Audi to shift to more proactive monitoring, avoiding

                                <p class="mb-1">Both machine vision and computer vision systems use a camera or cameras
                                    to capture video images or streams that they then process and analyze for automated
                                    decision-making. The primary difference between the systems is the depth of data
                                    processing each system does. Machine vision uses programmable logic controllers to
                                    quickly process and analyze images to make simple decisions, while computer vision
                                    uses PC-based processors for more robust image processing, making it a better fit
                                    for identifying and predicting trends or analyzing a greater number of variables.

                                    analyze, and adapt its actions to what it perceives. For example, a welding robot
                                    might align pieces, lay down a weld, and inspect the results.</p>
