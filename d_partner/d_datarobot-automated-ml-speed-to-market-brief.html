                            <p>The growing desire to gain business value from artificial intelligence (AI) has created a
                                gap between the demand for data science expertise and the supply of data scientists.
                                DataRobot’s automated machine learning (AutoML) platform, running on Intel®
                                architecture, addresses this challenge by automating many tasks needed to develop AI and
                                machine-learning applications.</p>
                            <p>DataRobot users can build accurate, transparent predictive models within minutes. Data
                                science experts can work more efficiently. Business users can create robust
                                machine-learning models by applying their understanding of enterprise data and business
                                processes. Organizations can apply AI to important business challenges and position
                                themselves for success in the emerging algorithm economy.</p>
                            <p>Optimized for the latest Intel technologies, the DataRobot AutoML solution delivers
                                unrivaled performance, memory capacity, and scalability for creating, training, and
                                deploying machine-learning models on familiar, cost-effective infrastructure. Using 2nd
                                Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors and Intel® Optane™ persistent memory,
                                organizations can train models on datasets of up to 100 GB. In benchmark tests, a system
                                with Intel Optane persistent memory trained at practically the same speed as a DRAM-only
                                system, depending on the dataset size and training method. The system with Intel Optane
                                persistent memory was projected to train up to a 1.33x larger dataset at the same memory
                                cost compared to a DRAM-only system.</p>

                            <p>Organizations of all sizes are eager to apply AI to their toughest challenges and most
                                exciting opportunities. Many recognize machine learning and other forms of AI as
                                powerful ways to gain competitive advantage by deriving fresh insights from their
                                growing data stores. The worldwide AI market, valued at USD 20.67 billion in 2018, is
                                projected to grow to USD 202.57 billion by 2026, a cumulative annual growth rate from
                                2019 of 33.1 percent.</p>
                            <p>The rising demand for AI solutions has led to significant shortfalls in AI talent.
                                According to a January 2020 report from TalentSeer, demand for people with AI skills
                                grew 74 percent in each of the four preceding years.3 In a Gartner Survey of 3,000
                                enterprise CIOs from 89 nations, 54 percent identified skills shortages as their biggest
                                AI challenge.</p>
                            <p>Along with the shortage of data science experts, machine-learning development is hampered
                                by tasks that are often complex, tedious, and time consuming. As a result, data
                                scientists spend valuable time performing these tasks instead of taking full advantage
                                of their expertise. In addition, many people with knowledge of business data lack the
                                specific skills to create machine-learning models. These issues slow AI development and
                                prevent enterprises from deploying AI as rapidly and extensively as business needs
                                require.</p>

                                developing and deploying machine-learning models.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Ingest data. DataRobot transforms structured and unstructured data into the specific
                                    format each algorithm needs for optimal performance. It follows best practices for
                                    data partitioning.</li>
                                <li>Engineer features. DataRobot develops new features from existing numeric,
                                    categorical, and text features. It knows which algorithms benefit from extra feature
                                    engineering and which don’t, and only generates features that make sense given the
                                    data characteristics.</li>
                                <li>Explore and select algorithms. DataRobot provides access to hundreds of algorithms
                                    along with the appropriate pre-processing for users to test against their data. It

                                    using smart tuning to optimize the most important hyper-parameters for each
                                    algorithm.</li>
                                <li>Find optimal algorithm combinations. Ensemble or blender models typically outperform
                                    individual algorithms. DataRobot finds the optimal algorithms to blend and tunes the
                                    weighting of the algorithms within each ensemble model.</li>
                                <li>Compare models head-to-head. DataRobot builds and trains dozens of models, compares

                                    showing which features have the greatest impact on the model’s accuracy and the
                                    patterns fitted for each feature. It provides explanations to illustrate the
                                    rationale behind a specific prediction.</li>
                                <li>Deploy production-ready models. DataRobot produces production-ready models that
                                    users can integrate with enterprise applications with just a few lines of code.
                                    Models can be deployed for real-time predictions, batch deployments, scoring on
                                    Apache Hadoop, or other methods. Users can develop their own models using R, Python,
                                    Apache Spark, MLlib, H2O, and other tools and call the DataRobot library to activate
                                    them.</li>
                                <li>Monitor and manage. Post-deployment, DataRobot makes it easy to compare predictions
                                    to actual results and train a new model on the latest data. DataRobot proactively
                                    highlights if a model’s performance is deteriorating over time.</li>

                                footprint of 6 to 25 times the size of the dataset. The range depended on the model
                                types as well as the percentage of data used for training. Because of the high ratio of
                                dataset-to-memory footprint, organizations training large datasets may need a large data
                                pool to avoid the performance drain of memory-capacity-bound workloads. Yet, configuring
                                a large, all-DRAM data pool can be prohibitively expensive.</p>
                            <p>The benchmarking team wanted to see how well Intel Optane persistent memory could address
                                this situation. Could Intel’s memory innovation provide DataRobot users with a
                                cost-effective solution for high-performance AutoML training on large datasets?</p>
                            <p>The team started by training DataRobot in Autopilot mode with a 50-GB test dataset. Then,
                                they selected several models from the leaderboard at random and re-trained them on two
                                systems that differed only in the type of memory in their worker nodes. One used all
                                DRAM, and the other used Intel Optane persistent memory. Figure 4 and Table 1 summarize
                                the benchmarking systems.</p>
                            <p>We configured both systems with the same memory capacity and compared the performance
                                (training time) of the two configurations. We expected Intel Optane persistent memory to
                                provide somewhat lower performance than the DRAM-only system. However, when we analyzed
                                the training time for the selected models, we found that performance on the system with
                                Intel Optane persistent memory was similar to the all-DRAM system, depending on the
                                model being trained.</p>
                            <p>Then, using an Intel pricing model, we reconfigured the two systems for the same memory
                                cost instead of the same capacity. Our analysis projected that Intel Optane persistent
                                memory would provide as much as a 1.33x larger dataset capacity for training than the
                                all-DRAM configuration, again depending on the model being trained.</p>
                            <p>Figure 4 shows these results for training on the Gradient Boosted Trees Classifier for
                                the Intel Optane persistent memory system relative to DRAM-only system. The left half of
                                the chart illustrates performance and performance per dollar for the same memory
                                capacity. The right side shows the projected training dataset capacity and training
                                dataset capacity per dollar for the equivalent memory cost.</p>
