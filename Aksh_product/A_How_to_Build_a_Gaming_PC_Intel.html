                                        preferences. When you determine everything that goes into your PC from the power
                                        supply up, you know that you'll be able to play the games you want at the frame
                                        rates you want. In addition, a home-built PC keeps the door open for upgrades—as
                                        technology changes, as your gaming tastes and needs change, or as your budget
                                        allows. </p>

                                                        look for a case that's close to that size. If you're not set on
                                                        a specific size, it's better to err on the larger side. You’ll
                                                        likely find that it’s easier to work with a bigger case and will

                                                        significantly bigger isn't necessarily better: Large cases can
                                                        end up with hotspots if not properly cooled.</p>

                                                        difficult. More expensive cases may have premium and convenience

                                                        management, but these features typically won't noticeably affect
