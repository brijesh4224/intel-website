                                <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Access, Correction, and Deletion.</strong> You have the right to: (1) request to know more about and access your personal information, including in a portable format; (2) request deletion of your personal information; and (3) request correction of inaccurate personal information. You can request access to, or correction or deletion of, your personal information by using the <a href="#" class="s_link_blue1">Intel Data Privacy Request Form</a> or by sending an email to <a href="#" class="s_link_blue1">dataprotectionofficer@intel.com</a>. We may verify your request by asking you to verify your email address or provide information related to your recent interactions with us.</p>
                                <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Opting Out of Sales, Sharing, and Targeted Advertising.</strong> You also have the right to opt out of “sharing,” “sales,” and use of your personal information for “targeted advertising”. You may opt out by clicking on the “Your Privacy Choices” link in the footer of that website and following the instructions in the pop-up window. Note that you will need to renew this opt-out choice if you visit our website from another device or browser or if you clear your cookies because your opt-out choice will be linked to your browser only.</p>
                                <p style="font-size: 20px;">You can also opt out by visiting our website with a legally recognized opt-out preference signal enabled, such as the Global Privacy Control.</p>
                                <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Nondiscrimination.</strong> We will not discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights.</p>
                                <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Authorized Agents.</strong> You can designate an authorized agent to make a privacy rights request on your behalf in certain circumstances. Intel may ask authorized agents to submit proof of their authority to make a request, such as proof that the agent has signed permission from the individual who is the subject of the request. In some cases, we may contact the consumer to verify their identity or confirm the authorized agent has permission to submit the request. If you are an authorized agent seeking to make a request, please complete <a href="#" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline">this form</a>.</p>
                                <p><strong>Appeals.</strong> If Intel denies your request, you may appeal our decision by contacting us as set forth in the <a href="#" class="s_link_blue1" >Contact Us</a> section below. If you have concerns about the results of an appeal, you may contact the attorney general in the state where you reside.</p>

                                <p style="font-size: 20px;">We may provide discounts, rewards, exclusive offers, or other benefits to individuals who participate in a promotional campaign. These offerings may constitute “financial incentives” or “bona fide loyalty programs” under certain state privacy laws (for simplicity, we refer to these collectively as “financial incentives”). If you decide to participate in a financial incentive, we collect personal information from you, such as identifiers (like your name and email address), commercial information (like information about purchases you have made), and inferences. We may disclose this information to our service providers, contractors, and consultants who perform services on our behalf and to our marketing and advertising partners, including for the purpose of engaging in targeted advertising and other marketing activities. You can opt into a financial incentive by following the sign-up or participation instructions provided, and you have the ability to opt-out at any time by following the instructions set forth in the applicable promotional campaign or by contacting us as set forth <a href="#" class="s_link_blue1">below</a>. If you request that we delete any of your personal information that is essential to providing you with the financial incentive, we will not be able to provide you with the benefits of that program. In some cases, we may provide additional terms and conditions, which we will provide to you when you sign up. The value of your personal information is reasonably related to the value of the offer or discount presented to you.</p>
