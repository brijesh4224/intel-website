                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Why SASE</h2>
                            <p>Enterprises are becoming more cloudified, and enterprise cloud networking is
                                transforming. The ability to support remote workforces with work-from-home (WFH)
                                technologies is helping make businesses more resilient, more efficient, and more
                                connected against marketplace disruptions. This shift has brought about the prevalence
                                of <a href="">software-defined wide area networks (SD-WANs)</a> as a form of virtual
                                overlay connectivity to help streamline the management of access and services to branch
                                offices in a classic hub-and-spoke model.
                            </p>
                            <p>However, SD-WAN is challenged by a complex security perimeter that spans many distributed
                                architectures and personal devices attempting to use cloud services through the
                                corporate network. SASE is taking off because of the need for more-advanced security and
                                brings an extended security posture with cloudlike agility to SD-WAN. Enterprises can
                                fully realize the benefits of cloud connectivity with the assurance that SASE can offer
                                centrally managed security capabilities to help fortify the network from end to end.</p>

                            <p>SASE is still in an emergent phase with some established use cases and many more on the

                                Edge (SSE) and WAN edge services. The SSE includes Firewall as a Service (FWaaS), cloud
                                access security broker (CASB), the secure web gateway (SWG), remote browser isolation
                                (RBI),

                            <p>FWaaS is a cloud-hosted firewall that filters data and traffic going to and coming from

                                many architectures, devices, and workloads. From a single point of orchestration, IT can
                                govern access to specific services, apps, and data for the entire enterprise network.

                            <p>Enterprises that take advantage of SASE benefit from a single-stack architecture that
                                delivers cloud access to remote users and branch offices fast, autonomously, and at
                                scale.
                                The SASE framework will continue to evolve to be smarter and more cloud native in the

                            <p>In the SASE model, workloads for both security functions and SD-WAN traffic are hosted in
                                remote locations, often in a colocation or telco point-of-presence (POP) facility.
                                Colocation describes privately owned servers in a third-party data center, whereas POP
                                describes privately owned servers in a data center owned by a telco. SASE can be hosted
                                in
                                the public cloud as well.
                            </p>
                            <p>SASE capabilities are software defined by nature, relying on the same architecture as
                                data
                                center and cloud server technology paired with software vendor solutions to enable
                                features
                                such as FWaaS, CASB, and SWG.</p>

                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3"><b>SD-WAN vs. SASE</b></h2>
                            <p>SASE embraces SD-WAN by bringing a unified security framework and running it end to end
                                on
                                SD-WAN infrastructure. Decision-makers will not choose one or the other; rather they
                                will
                                deploy a fully integrated solution that uses SD-WAN as a foundation for connectivity,
                                with
                                flexible security capabilities enabled by SASE.

                            <p>Intel’s breadth of expertise includes everything cloud combined with a deep understanding
                                of
                                data center server architecture, enterprise workstations, and embedded computing. This
                                comprehensiveness empowers enterprises to build a cohesive edge-to-cloud infrastructure
                                based on Intel® technology. Intel also works with a vast ecosystem of cloud service
                                providers and software vendors to optimize performance on Intel® hardware, helping to
                                ensure
                                that enterprise customers get the most value out of their SASE investments.

                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">The Future of SASE</h2>
                            <p>As of 2021, 64 percent of enterprises have or plan to deploy SASE-based services in some
                                form.1 The state of flux that enterprises currently find themselves in also generates a
                                high
                                potential for innovation. For example, SASE is on the verge of integrating endpoint
                                security
                                capabilities like malware detection with event log correlation and AI. SASE can use
                                these
                                capabilities to intelligently predict threats and autonomously regulate network traffic.
                                As
                                enterprise needs evolve, so will SASE capabilities and the ease of implementation.
