                        <p>To say that digital visual effects (VFX) had an impact on movie making would be a tremendous
                            understatement. Digital VFX was a paradigm shift. It introduced entirely new ways to tell
                            stories and provide viewers new experiences. From Star Wars to the latest Avatar movie, with
                            each new evolution of the technologies behind digital VFX, movies (and television,
                            streaming, gaming, commercials, digital art—all motion media expressions) give the artists
                            behind digital VFX creative ways to take us to new worlds.</p>
                        <p>Whether at home, in the gallery, or in the theater, viewers want rich experiences. That means
                            taking the next digital VFX project to a new level. And that requires computing—sometimes
                            enormous amounts of computing. Yet while news headlines often boast how movie budgets have
                            gone sky-high, effects budgets are still tight, competition among effects studios to produce
                            them is fierce. The cost and efficiency of the computation behind the effects must follow
                            suit.</p>
                        <p><a href="">Gunpowder</a>, a digital VFX service and technology provider, combines its
                            knowledge of the efficiencies of hyperscale cloud capabilities with its expertise in effects
                            creation and rendering. Gunpowder has provided rendering services for digital artists, such
                            as <a href="">Refik Anadol</a> and <a href="">Urs Fischer</a>, using Google Cloud,
                            leveraging sometimes tens of thousands of servers around the world. The company recently
                            tested new Google Cloud instances with <a href="">4th Gen Intel® Xeon® processors</a>.
                            Benchmarks showed both accelerated rendering times and lower cost—as much as 52 percent
                            better performance/dollar1—compared to instances with earlier generations of Intel® Xeon®
                            processors. These are benefits that serve both the artists and the producers.</p>

                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Challenge</h2>
                        <p>It’s 2020, and the COVID-19 pandemic is raging. Studios are shut down; VFX departments are
                            trying to figure out how to work remotely. Tom Taylor, founder of Gunpowder, leverages his
                            technical knowledge of rendering software and systems as well as capabilities of cloud
                            services to create high-performance compute in the cloud, allowing digital artists to work
                            from anywhere. Over the last few years, Gunpowder has continued to grow, using Google Cloud
                            instances to power their rendering services. When it comes to rendering, more is always
                            better.</p>
                        <p>“There’s no such thing as too much firepower in terms of rendering,” Taylor states. “When you
                            submit a render, it’s going to try and use every resource available. If I spin up a 60-core
                            machine, the moment I hit render, all 60 cores get pinned at 100% until that render
                            completes.”</p>
                        <p>What that means for Gunpowder’s clients is that the more computing available for rendering,
                            the faster it will get done. And time is everything in the VFX business.</p>
                        <p>“In our industry,” Taylor adds, “speed—and time—is money. The deadline drives everything. A
                            piece of content from a creative perspective is never finished. The more iterations an
                            artist can complete, the better the end product.”</p>
                        <p>For Taylor and Gunpowder, performance of the cloud instance—and cost of that instance—are
                            essential to provide a competitive service to an industry where timelines are short, budgets
                            are tight, and margins are thin.</p>
                        <p>Enter—the 4th Gen Intel Xeon processors and <a href="">Google Cloud C3 Instances.</a></p>
                        <p></p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Solution</h2>
                        <p>Gunpowder consults with studios that want to build their own rendering system in the cloud or
                            extend or migrate their on-premises solution to the cloud. The company also provides
                            on-demand rendering capacity for customers.</p>
                        <p><b>Performance, Performance, Performance</b></p>
                        <p>Currently Gunpowder services run on Google Cloud C2 instances—ultra high-performance
                            configurations for compute-intensive workloads built on 2nd Gen Intel® Xeon® processors—and
                            n1 instances—configurations balanced for price/performance built on earlier version of Intel
                            Xeon processors. But Google Cloud is deploying C3 instances running 4th Gen Intel Xeon
                            processors. These new C3 instances feature Google Cloud’s custom <a href="">Intel®
                                Infrastructure Processing Engine</a> and <a href="">Intel® Advanced Matrix
                                Extensions</a> to speed up training and inference.</p>
                        <p>“We ran a benchmark using our traditional renderers through the C2 and C3 instances,” Taylor
                            explained.</p>
                        <p>“We compared the results and immediately saw a 25 to 30 percent quicker render time on C3
                            instances. Remember that with VFX, the faster the render the more time to perfect the art
                            through more iterations. Essentially, we’re giving the artists more time to do their work.”
                        </p>
                        <p>Additionally, in the cloud, everything is billed per second. If a render takes fewer seconds,
                            the customer gets billed less.</p>
                        <p>“So, it’s a win-win—better performance for cheaper,” Taylor adds. “Who wouldn’t buy that?”
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Better Performance/$</b></p>
                        <p>Google instances are available in different configurations, or shapes. The C2 standard shape
                            has twice the memory of a C3 highcpu shape. It turns out that most renderers tend to run
                            well with the reduced memory of the C3 highcpu shape. The instance shape with less memory
                            helps reduce the price of the instance. Thus, the combination of the C3 highcpu shape and
                            faster render times delivers over 50 percent better performance/$ compared to C2 instances.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Numbers Help Tell the Story</b></p>
                        <p>When Gunpowder ran their benchmarks, they tested two main render engines on both C2 and C3
                            instances.</p>

                        <p>Gunpowder estimated instance costs on Google Cloud Iowa Data Center as follows:</p>
                        <p class="mb-0"><b>C2-standard-30: $1.566/hr</b></p>
                        <p><b>C3-highcpu-44: $1.8942/hr</b></p>
                        <p>With both benchmarks, the Google Cloud C3 instances ran faster, due to more cores and the new
                            CPU architecture. They also cost less to complete than the C2 resulting in a better
                            performance/cost.</p>
                        <p>“When the VFX studios bid a project, they have to work within their estimate,” Taylor said,
                            “which means they need their rendering system to be as efficient and cost-effective as
                            possible. Whatever we can do to help them keep costs down while accelerating rendering is a
                            benefit to them. The C3 instances will help us do that.”</p>

                        <p>Rendering is a compute-intensive task. The more complex the imagery and higher the
                            resolution, the more computing is required. Working with Google Cloud, Gunpowder can set up
                            a rendering service tuned for each project, whether all rendering is done on the cloud or
                            leverages the client’s on-premises technology. For example, a recent client needed to <a
                                href="">render ocean coral imagery</a> generated by AI using 100 million images of
                            underwater plant and animal life.</p>
                        <p>“The client approached us with a requirement to connect multiple nodes to their on-premises
                            system and render the imagery showcased at the World Economic Forum earlier this year.
                            Through our efforts, we were able to set up numerous render nodes, establish connections
                            with their equipment, and make optimal use of their existing licensing resources.” Some
                            render jobs require thousands of nodes, which for a single project is nearly impossible to
                            complete in-house for all but the very largest studios. For such projects, Gunpowder
                            leverages Google Cloud’s presence to set up nodes from around the world. To help keep costs
                            down, spot instances—unused instances in data centers around the world—are sought.</p>
                        <p>“For a very large project that required 10,000 render nodes, we searched for Google Cloud
                            spot instances around the world,” Taylor explained. “That project used 2,500 3D scans of
                            everyday objects interacting in a moving environment displayed on a 10k screen1 at the <a
                                href="">Gagosian Gallery</a> in New York.”</p>
                        <p>According to Taylor, these are projects that benefit from the performance and cost benefits
                            of Google Cloud C3 instances.</p>

                        <p>Digital VFX rendering is a compute-intensive operation that can require many nodes running at
                            100 percent. Since time is of the essence with digital VFX studios, technologies that reduce
                            render time benefit the quality of the project by giving artists more opportunities to
                            perfect their creations. <a href="">Google Cloud C3 instances built on 4th Gen Intel Xeon
                                processors</a> gives Gunpowder significant performance and cost improvement over C2
                            instances, helping to accelerate render jobs and reduce costs for its customers.</p>
