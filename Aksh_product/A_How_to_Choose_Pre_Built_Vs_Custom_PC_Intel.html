                                        sizing up the specs and features of your next build, the first step in the
                                        selection process is determining what type of PC is right for you.</p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">If you are still on the fence between a laptop and a desktop, click
                                        over to our <a href="#" class="V_andecor_r">gaming laptop vs gaming desktop
                                            comparison article</a> before proceeding.</p>
                                    <p class="V_pv mb-0">Assuming you already know you want a desktop, the next step is
                                        choosing between a pre-built PC vs custom PC. One of the biggest draws of PC
                                        gaming is having the ability to choose a system that aligns with your
                                        preferences, needs, and skill level at working on your system. While there is a
                                        spectrum of options available, you generally have three choices:</p>
                                    <ul class="V_pv mb-0">
                                        <li><strong>You can buy a PC that’s already been built</strong>. Pre-built
                                            gaming PCs are complete systems put together by well-known manufacturers
                                            using balanced and reliable hardware configurations. They are produced in
                                            quantity by some of the most trusted names in the PC space. These are
                                            usually available in local stores and are designed to be ready to use right
                                            out of the box.</li>
                                        <li><strong>You can have someone else build it for you</strong>. Another option
                                            is to order your build from a company who specializes in building custom
                                            PCs. Custom-built gaming PCs offer a broader range of customization options
                                            than pre-builts without requiring you to roll up your sleeves and build a PC
                                            yourself. You select the features and components you want, relying on a team
                                            of qualified technicians to build a PC to your specifications.</li>
                                        <li><strong>You can build a PC yourself</strong>. Lastly, you can obtain the
                                            individual components and assemble them at home. Choosing to build a gaming
                                            PC gives you ultimate authority over the look, design, and performance of
                                            your PC. This route also comes with unique challenges that require some
                                            technical know-how to navigate.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p class="V_pv">While there is some overlap between them, each option has its own
                                        distinct advantages, and they are all worth taking into consideration. Your
                                        choice should ultimately be based on the important factors of budget,
                                        convenience, and the level of customization you want. Let’s explore each
                                        category in closer detail.</p>

                                            about when buying a new PC: the components inside. Gaming on PC lets you get
                                            the performance you want with the hardware you choose. But you don’t have to
                                            make granular decisions about hardware yourself. You can let someone else
                                            make those choices for you, if you prefer.
