                                While Intel’s primary product focus is on the processors, or brains, that make computers
                                work, system memory (that’s DRAM) is a critical component for performance. This is
                                especially true in servers, where the multiplication of processing cores has outpaced
                                the rise in memory bandwidth (in other words, the memory bandwidth available per core
                                has fallen).  </p>
                            <p>In heavy-duty computing jobs like weather modeling, computational fluid dynamics and
                                certain types of AI, this mismatch could create a bottleneck — until now.  </p>
                            <p>After several years of development with industry partners, Intel engineers have found a
                                path to open that bottleneck, crafting a novel solution that has created the fastest
                                system memory ever and is set to become <a href=""  style="color: #0068B5; text-decoration: underline  dashed !important;text-underline-offset: .3rem !important;"> a new open industry standard</a>.
                                The recently
                                introduced Intel® Xeon® 6 data center processors are the first to benefit from this new
                                memory, called MRDIMMs, for higher performance — in the most plug-and-play manner
                                imaginable.</p>
                            <p>Intel’s Bhanu Jaiswal, Xeon product manager in Intel’s Data Center and AI (DCAI) group,
                                explains that “a significant percentage of high-performance computing workloads are
                                memory-bandwidth bound,” the kind most set to benefit from MRDIMMs.</p>
                            <p>It sounds almost too good to be true — here’s the story behind the DDR5 Multiplexed Rank
                                Dual Inline Memory Module, or MRDIMM for storytelling efficiency. </p>
                            <p><strong>Bringing Parallelism to System Memory, with Friends</strong></p>
                            <p>It turns out the most common memory modules used for data center jobs, known as RDIMMs,
                                do have parallel resources on board, like modern processors do. They’re just not used
                                that way.</p>
                            <p>“Most DIMMs have two ranks for performance and capacity,” says George Vergis, a senior
                                principal engineer in memory pathfinding in DCAI. “It’s the sweet spot.”
                            </p>
                            <p>You can think of ranks like, well, banks – one set of memory chips on a module would
                                belong to one and the rest to the other rank. With RDIMMs, data can be stored and
                                accessed across multiple ranks independently but not simultaneously.</p>
                            <p>Considering this situation, recalls Vergis, “We’re like, ‘Wait a minute. We’ve got
                                parallel resources that are unused. Why can’t we put them together?’” The idea that
                                Vergis pursued was to put a small interface chip – a multiplexer or “mux” – on the DRAM
                                module. It allows data to flow across both ranks of memory in the same unit of time.</p>
                            <p>The mux buffer consolidates each MRDIMM’s electrical load, which allows the interface to
                                operate at a higher speed compared to RDIMMs. And now that both ranks of memory can be
                                accessed in parallel, its bandwidth has doubled.</p>
                            <p>The result is the fastest system memory ever created – by a leap that would normally take
                                several generations of memory technologies to achieve (in this case, peak bandwidth
                                rises by almost 40%, from 6,400 megatransfers per second (MT/s) to 8,800 MT/s).</p>
                            <p><strong>Same Standard Memory Module, Just Faster</strong></p>
                            <p>At this point you might have your own “wait a minute” question: Is Intel getting back
                                into the memory business? No. Although Intel started as a memory company and invented
                                technologies including EPROM and DRAM, the company has exited its various memory product
                                businesses over its history (some quite famously).</p>
                            <p>But Intel never stopped the “lifts all boats” efforts that make different computing
                                components interoperable and higher performing. Vergis represents Intel on the board of
                                JEDEC, which sets open standards for the microelectronics industry, most notably for
                                memory. <a href=""  style="color: #0068B5; text-decoration: underline  dashed !important;text-underline-offset: .3rem !important;"> Vergis earned a JEDEC award in 2018</a> for his work on the DDR5
                                standard, and right
                                now he’s devoting time to DDR6. (JEDEC also <a href=""  style="color: #0068B5; text-decoration: underline  dashed !important;text-underline-offset: .3rem !important;"> honored Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger
                                    this year</a>
                                for a career as “a strong proponent of open standards as evidenced by Intel’s historic
                                leadership in developing standards.”)</p>
                            <p>Vergis and his cohorts started this work in 2018 and proved the concept with prototypes
                                by 2021. Intel teamed up with the memory ecosystem to build <a href=""  style="color: #0068B5; text-decoration: underline  dashed !important;text-underline-offset: .3rem !important;">the first
                                    components</a>, and
                                donated the specs to JEDEC as a new open standard in late 2022.</p>
                            <p>What stands out about the MRDIMM is its ease of use. It employs the same connector and
                                form factor as a regular RDIMM (even the little mux chips fit in previously empty spots
                                on the module), thus requiring no changes in the motherboard.</p>
                            <p>MRDIMMs also bring along all the same error-correcting and reliability, availability and
                                serviceability (RAS) features as RDIMMs. Data integrity is maintained no matter how
                                separate requests might be multiplexed across the data buffer, Vergis explains.</p>
                            <p>This all means data center customers can choose MRDIMMs when they order a new server, or
                                later they can slide that server out of the rack and swap the RDIMMs for new MRDIMMs.
                                Not a single line of code needs to change to enjoy newfound performance.</p>
                            <p>Xeon 6 + MRDIMM = 🚀🚀</p>
                            <p>What is required is a CPU that can work with MRDIMMs, and the first one available is the
                                Intel Xeon 6 processor with Performance-cores, code-named Granite Rapids, which came to
                                market this year.</p>
                            <p>Recent <a href=""  style="color: #0068B5; text-decoration: underline  dashed !important;text-underline-offset: .3rem !important;">independent tests compared</a> two identical Xeon 6 systems, one with
                                MRDIMMs and the other with RDIMMs. The system with MRDIMMs completed jobs as much as 33%
                                faster.</p>
                            <p>Jaiswal says the “improvement in bandwidth that MRDIMM delivers is very much applicable
                                to small language models and traditional deep learning and recommendation system types
                                of AI workloads that can easily run on Xeon and achieve a good performance boost with
                                MRDIMM.”</p>
                            <p>Leading memory vendors have introduced MRDIMMs, with additional memory makers expected to
                                launch more. High-performance computing labs – such as the National Institute for
                                Quantum Science and Technology and National Institute for Fusion Science, among others –
                                are actively adopting Xeon 6 with P-cores because of MRDIMMs, with support from OEMs
                                like NEC.</p>
                                <p>“Intel definitely has a lead,” Jaiswal notes, “backed by a strong ecosystem of OEMs and memory vendors.”</p>
