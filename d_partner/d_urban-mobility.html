                            <p>At its core, urban mobility is about how people and goods move through a city. It seems
                                simple, but as you consider all factors—infrastructure, technology, politics,
                                culture—how we navigate cities is a complex subject with an ancient history and an
                                increasingly sophisticated technology-fueled future.

                            <p>The fundamental challenges of getting around a city have been with us since humans began
                                living in urban environments. How do we balance congestion, ease of movement, and
                                pollution?</p>
                            <p>The tensions between innovation in transportation, constantly growing urban populations,
                                and civic government’s ability to keep up with limited resources are timeless. But the
                                pressure today’s cities face is unprecedented.</p>
                            <p>Urban population growth will continue to strain urban mobility:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>4.6 billion city dwellers by 2025 <sup>1</sup></li>
                                <li>41 megacities by 2030 <sup>2</sup></li>
                                <li>67.1 trillion passenger kilometers on mass transit by 2050 <sup>3</sup></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b>Congestion</b></p>
                            <p>Time spent sitting in traffic is a major drain for individual commuters and the overall
                                productivity of the world’s cities. According to a 2019 Global Traffic Scorecard from
                                INRIX,3 the US lost an average of 99 hours per driver to congestion in 2019, costing
                                nearly USD 88 billion in lost productivity.</p>
                            <p><b>Public Safety</b></p>
                            <p>Congested roadways do more than waste time. Traffic accidents kill 1.35 million people
                                around the world each year and leave between 20 and 50 million people with nonfatal
                                injuries. More than half of all road traffic deaths and injuries involve pedestrians,
                                cyclists, and motorcyclists and their passengers.</p>
                            <p><b>Public Health</b></p>
                            <p>Congested stop-and-go traffic increases the volume of microscopic particulates in vehicle
                                exhaust.4 According to the World Health Organization, exhaust particulates are “capable
                                of penetrating deep into lung passageways and entering the bloodstream causing
                                cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory impacts.”</p>
                            <p><b>Environmental Impact</b></p>
                            <p>Cities everywhere are concerned about environmental sustainability, and transportation is
                                a major contributing factor.</p>
                            <p>An estimated 22 percent of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are attributed to the
                                transportation sector,6 which will rise as cities grow and individual citizens adopt
                                carbon-burning transportation.</p>
                            <p>For example, without major investments in public transportation and smart road
                                technologies, CO2 emissions in India are projected to rise from 70 megatons in 2015 to
                                540 megatons by 2050.</p>

                                happening on a city’s streets, highways, and rail lines in near-real time. With the help
                                of AI, this awareness can transform passive traffic management into active intelligent
                                transportation systems.</p>
                            <p>These systems can anticipate congestion, automatically reroute traffic, retime lights,
                                and apply dynamic tolling to help keep the city moving. The city of Bangkok, Thailand,
                                is saving over 51,000 commuter hours a year and reducing traffic delays up to 24.5
                                percent with just three smart intersections.</p>

                            <p>Multiple technologies are coming online that will fundamentally change how people and
                                goods move through cities. Increasing vehicle intelligence, a</p>
                            <p><b>Vehicle Communication and Orchestrated Traffic</b></p>
                            <p>Vehicle communications technologies will turn the current state of unpredictable, “dumb”
                                vehicles into smart, active players within the smart city’s intelligent transportation
                                system.</p>
                            <p>Vehicle communication—between individual smart vehicles and from smart vehicles to
                                central traffic management systems—will help traffic flow as an intelligent, unified
                                whole that maintains consistent speeds and set vehicle distances. Throughput and fuel
                                efficiency will increase dramatically as accidents drop and pollution eases.</p>
                            <p>Researchers in Germany have built an experimental two-kilometer test field on the
                                autobahn that communicates with vehicles and orchestrates traffic. It uses overlapping
                                radar sensors to model traffic in near-real time. The system shares this information
                                with oncoming cars, signaling them when it is safe to change lanes, when to reduce
                                speed, and when to avoid critical situations.</p>
                            <p><b>Smarter, More-Flexible Public Transportation</b></p>
                            <p>Bus and rail will continue to be fundamental elements of urban mobility. Incremental
                                technological upgrades, using open platforms consolidated onto standard x86 hardware,
                                can support smart security video, monitor vehicle systems, and deliver AI-powered
                                predictive maintenance.</p>
                            <p>These platforms can also support better rider experiences by providing Wi-Fi, onboard
                                entertainment, and interactive information displays.</p>
                            <p><b>Mobility as a Service (MaaS)</b></p>
                            <p>Getting around a city today takes planning and effort, whether you are driving your own
                                car, ride sharing, or navigating public transportation. Smart cities with intelligent
                                transportation systems and open data platforms are changing mobility from a chore into a
                                service.</p>
                            <p>Commuters today can choose from multiple apps, like Moovit, that can plan routes and
                                schedules across public transit. As cities grow smarter, and the number of autonomous,
                                connected vehicles increases, mobility as a service (MaaS) applications will be able to
                                weave every available transportation option into a seamless, multimodal trip. Commuters
                                will save time while the system optimizes traffic flow, energy efficiency, and vehicle
                                use across the city.</p>

                            <p>Reaching the highest levels of intelligent transportation and smart, energy-efficient
                                urban mobility requires many, many technologies. Thankfully, upgrading a city is not an
                                all-or-nothing proposition. Many of the technologies are already in place; others only
                                need incremental upgrades. The biggest challenges—privacy, data security, data
                                ownership—lie at the intersection of technology and public policy.</p>

                            <p>Cities already collect massive amounts of data through existing systems like traffic and
                                public safety cameras. Incremental upgrades can transform them into intelligent nodes in
                                a smart city fabric.</p>
                            <p><b>Everywhere AI</b></p>
                            <p>To function in near-real time, intelligent transportation systems need immediate insight
                                and analysis. That requires processing AI workloads at the edge, on a smart device
                                itself, or on a nearby AI appliance.</p>
