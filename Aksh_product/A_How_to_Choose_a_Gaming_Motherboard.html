                                        of your hardware to your processor, distributes electricity from your power
                                        supply, and defines the types of storage devices, memory modules, and graphics
                                        cards (among other expansion cards) that can connect to your PC.</p>

                                    <p class="V_pv ">A motherboard is a PC’s primary circuit board. Though
                                        motherboard aesthetics change over time, their basic design makes it easy to
                                        connect new expansion cards, hard drives, and memory modules, as well as replace
                                        old ones.</p>

                                        <p class="V_pv">Motherboards usually contain at least one processor socket,
                                            enabling your CPU (the PC’s mechanical “brain”) to communicate with other
                                            critical components. These include memory (RAM), storage, and other devices
                                            installed in expansion slots — both internal devices like GPUs and external
                                            devices like peripherals.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">(Not all motherboards have a socket, though: in systems with
                                            less space, like mini PCs and most laptops, the CPU is soldered into the
                                            motherboard.)</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">When selecting a motherboard, check your CPU’s <a href="#"
                                                class="V_andecor_r fw-lighter">documentation</a> to ensure the board is
                                            compatible with your CPU. Sockets vary in order to support different
                                            products based on generation, performance, and other factors by changing the
                                            pin array. (The name of the socket comes from the pin array: for example,
                                            the LGA 1151 socket, compatible with 9th Gen CPUs, has 1,151 pins.)</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Modern motherboards connect CPUs directly to RAM, from which it
                                            fetches instructions from different programs, as well as to some expansion
                                            slots that can hold performance-critical components such as GPUs and storage
                                            drives. The memory controller lives on the CPU itself, but numerous other
                                            devices communicate with the CPU through the chipset, which controls many
                                            expansion slots, SATA connections, USB ports, and sound and network
                                            functions.

                                            connect via PCIe.

                                        <p class="V_pv">Each PCIe link contains a specified number of data lanes, listed
                                            as ×1, ×4, ×8, or ×16 (often pronounced “by one,” “by four,” etc.). Each
                                            lane consists of two pairs of wires: one transmits data and the other
                                            receives data.

                                        <p class="V_pv">With current-generation PCIe implementations, a PCIe ×1 link has
                                            one data lane with a transfer rate of one bit per cycle. A PCIe×16 lane,
                                            typically the longest slot on your motherboard (and also the one used most
                                            often for a graphics card), has 16 data lanes capable of transferring up to
                                            16 bits per cycle. However, future iterations of PCIe will allow doubling
                                            the data rate per clock cycle.

                                        <p class="V_pv">Each revision of PCIe has roughly doubled the bandwidth of the
                                            previous generation, and that means better performance for PCIe devices. A
                                            PCIe 2.0 ×16 link has a theoretical, bidirectional peak bandwidth of 16
                                            GB/s; a PCIe 3.0 ×16 link has a peak of 32 GB/s. When comparing PCIe 3.0
                                            lanes, the ×4 link commonly used by many solid-state drives has a peak
                                            theoretical bandwidth of 8 GB/s, whereas the ×16 link that GPUs leverage
                                            offers four times as much.

                                            PCIe is the option to use slots with more lanes as a substitute for
                                            slots with fewer lanes. For example, a ×4 expansion card can be inserted
                                            into a ×16 slot and work normally. However, its throughput will be the
                                            same as if it was in a ×4 slot — the 12 additional lanes simply go
                                            unused.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Some motherboards have M.2 and PCIe slots that could use more
                                            PCIe lanes than are actually available on the platform. For example, some
                                            motherboards may have seven PCIe x16 slots, which could theoretically use
                                            112 lanes, but the processor and chipset may feature only 48 lanes.

                                        <p class="V_pv">If all lanes are in use, PCIe slots will often switch to a lower
                                            bandwidth configuration. For example, if a pair of GPUs are installed in two
                                            ×16 PCIe slots, the links may run at ×8 rather than ×16 (modern GPUs are
                                            unlikely to be bottlenecked by a PCIe 3.0 ×8 connection). Some premium
                                            motherboards may use PCIe switches that fan out the physical lanes, however,
                                            so the slot lane configurations can remain unchanged.

                                    <p class="V_pv">The first thing you see when your computer starts up is the BIOS, or
                                        Basic Input/Output System. This is the firmware that loads before your operating
                                        system boots up, and it’s responsible for starting up and testing all connected
                                        hardware.</p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">Though often referred to as the BIOS by users and motherboard labels
                                        alike, the firmware on modern motherboards is typically UEFI (Unified Extensible
                                        Firmware Interface). This more flexible environment boasts many user-friendly
                                        improvements, such as support for larger storage partitions, speedier boot-up,
                                        and a modern GUI (graphical user interface).
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">Motherboard manufacturers often add UEFI utilities that streamline
                                        the process of overclocking the PC’s CPU or memory and provide helpful presets.
                                        They may also feature a stylized appearance, add logging and screenshot
                                        features, simplify processes like booting from another drive, and display
                                        monitor memory, temperature, and fan speeds.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">UEFI also supports older features of the BIOS. Users can boot into
                                        Legacy mode (also known as CSM, or Compatibility Support Module) to access the
                                        classic BIOS, which may solve compatibility issues with older operating programs
                                        or utilities. However, when users boot in Legacy mode, they obviously lose the
                                        modern benefits of UEFI, such as support for partitions over 2TB. (Note: always
                                        backup important data before switching boot modes).

                                        its I/O controller manages these devices. Consumer motherboards provide ports
                                        that connect a CPU’s integrated graphics to your monitor (useful if you don’t
                                        have a discrete graphics card or are troubleshooting display issues),
                                        peripherals like a keyboard and mouse, audio devices, Ethernet cables, and more.
                                        Different revisions of these ports, like USB 3.1 Gen 2, can allow greater
                                        speeds.

                                    <p class="V_pv">Motherboards group external ports on their back panel, which is
                                        covered with a removable or integrated “I/O shield” that is grounded due to its
                                        contact with an often metal case. This is sometimes attached to the motherboard,
                                        or comes separately to be installed when putting together the system.

                                    </h2>

                                    <p class="V_pv">It’s helpful to know a few basic terms related to motherboard
                                        manufacturing, as manufacturer ads and manuals often reference their methods of
                                        PCB construction.</p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">A modern motherboard is a printed circuit board (PCB) made of layers
                                        of fiberglass and copper, with other components mounted on it or socketed into
                                        it.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">Modern PCBs usually have around 10 layers, making them much more
                                        densely interconnected than they appear on the surface.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">Each conductive “trace” — the visible lines covering the surface of
                                        the board — is a separate electrical connection. If one of these traces gets
                                        damaged, the circuit is no longer complete, and motherboard components will
                                        cease to function properly. For example, if a trace leading from a PCIe link to
                                        the PCH is deeply scratched, the PCIe slot may no longer power the expansion
                                        card installed in it.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">After conductive traces are created via chemical etching,
                                        manufacturers add the solder mask, a traditionally green polymer coating that
                                        helps prevent oxidation. It also helps prevent handling damage, ensuring that
                                        traces won’t be disrupted by a minor scratch or bump as you install the
                                        motherboard in its case.
