                        <p>The initial rollout of the Intel SUR solution began with 3,000 Dell devices. The
                            implementation included installing the software on these devices. “We were able to package
                            the software for a deployment via Microsoft Intune, and it was extremely smooth,” noted Pete
                            Rodriguez, Senior Network Administrator at CUSD. This setup enabled telemetry data to be
                            uploaded to the cloud every 24 hours, where Intel’s systems processed CUSD’s data.</p>
                        <div style="padding: 30px; display: flex; align-items: start;">
                            <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left me-4" style="font-size: 100px; color: #E5E6E6;"></i><i>“We
                                didn’t have this visibility before, so it was a little overwhelming at first, but
                                [Intel] presented the data to us in a really consumable fashion.” —Colleen Flannery,
                                CTO, CUSD
                            </i>
                        </div>
                        <p>Intel then developed custom reports based on CUSD’s needs using Microsoft PowerBI,
                            transforming the data into clear, usable visualizations. These reports included support and
                            reference materials to ensure the district could easily access and utilize the data for
                            decision making.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the rollout, there was an open line of communication. As Chief Technology Officer
                            Colleen Flannery noted, the relationship between Intel and CUSD was very reciprocal. “[The
                            SUR process] is really a model to how we’re trying to solve problems in education,” Flannery
                            asserts, “as we come together with each other’s knowledge to learn and grow from each
                            other.”</p>
                        <p>After reviewing the initial reports, CUSD recognized the significant value in the insights
                            provided by the SUR solution, which prompted them to expand their implementation of the
                            solution by 10,000 devices. This allowed them to gather more comprehensive data for current
                            and future technology decisions, ensuring that their next processor investment would be
                            tailored to their needs.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;" class="fw-lighter">Results</h2>
                        <p>CUSD’s decision to add an additional 10,000 devices wasn't made lightly. The telemetry data
                            collected from existing devices revealed a staggering hidden truth—over 97% of their devices
                            were compute-bound during peak usage periods, such as grading and testing times. This
                            realization highlighted an urgent need for high-performance devices to support their users'
                            needs.</p>
                        <p>CUSD now has improved visibility into device performance, power usage, and other aspects of
                            their technology fleet. The partnership with Intel provided quantifiable evidence about
                            device usage and performance, not only validating past technology investments but also
                            informing future purchasing decisions. Additionally, Intel’s SUR solution enabled proactive

                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;" class="fw-lighter">Next Steps for Chandler Unified School
                            District</h2>
                        <p>Looking ahead, CUSD plans to build on the success of its SUR implementation with several
                            strategic steps. Telemetry data and custom reports from Intel have extracted actionable
                            insights tailored to CUSD’s specific needs. Key lessons learned from the project include the
                            importance of identifying data that is meaningful and actionable based on district-specific
                            needs and the value of effective collaboration between Intel and school districts. Insights
                            from telemetry data can help provide a point of validation to school boards and decision
                            makers on future refreshes as well as past technology investments.</p>
                        <p>In the future, CUSD and Intel may use predictive analytics to target device refreshes based
                            on need rather than age or fleet cohort. Continuous enhancement of data collection methods
                            is planned to further improve device management and decision-making processes. For example,
                            Intel assigns each device a randomized GUID (globally unique identifier) to aggregate data
                            for statistical reports, ensuring no personally identifiable information (PII) is collected.
                            With continued collaboration, CUSD could align each GUID with its device ID to detect and
                            mitigate individual device issues and assess user experience and usage by cohorts, such as
                            by classroom, grade level, or school.</p>

                            cannot match.</p>
                        <p>As the processor manufacturer, Intel can capture and analyze this telemetry data accurately
                            without collecting any personally identifiable information (PII). This helps schools and
                            organizations make informed decisions to optimize device performance and address any
                            technology challenges effectively.</p>
