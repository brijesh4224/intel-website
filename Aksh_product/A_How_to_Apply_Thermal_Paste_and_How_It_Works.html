                                            cooling solution. When people think about thermal paste in the context of
                                            building a PC, they’re probably referring to the process of installing a CPU
                                            cooler. When you buy a graphics card, for example, the thermal solution is
                                            already integrated. You don’t usually have to worry about installing a
                                            cooler onto a GPU, unless you are interested in aftermarket solutions like
                                            custom liquid cooling. With a CPU cooler, you have the option to choose the
                                            one you want, but that means you’ll usually need to install it yourself.

                                            worth defining some of the terms we will be using.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv"><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU) -</strong> The information
                                            processing center of a PC. It executes all operational instructions and
                                            sends instructions to the other hardware in the computer. If the computer is
                                            a body, then the CPU is the brain, and it is absolutely critical to the
                                            functioning of any PC. Modern CPUs execute a high volume of operations per
                                            second, and this generates heat. In order for a CPU to operate at peak
                                            efficiency, it needs to be properly cooled, usually with a cooling apparatus
                                            designed just for this purpose. This is where thermal paste becomes
                                            important. If you'd like to learn more about how a CPU is made, you can read
                                            more about the manufacturing process.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv"><strong>Integrated Heat Spreader (IHS) -</strong> The metal
                                            “lid” of the CPU. This serves as a heat sink designed to distribute heat
                                            from the processor itself to a CPU cooler, as well as provide protection to
                                            the processor inside. This is the part of the CPU that is still exposed
                                            after being installed in a motherboard, and is the surface to which you
                                            apply thermal paste.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv"><strong>CPU Cooler - </strong>The device that keeps your CPU
                                            running at optimal temperatures. CPU coolers usually use air or liquid to
                                            relocate the heat created by the operation of the CPU.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv"><strong>Base-Plate - </strong>The metal base of an air-cooler
                                            that attaches to the IHS of the CPU. This design allows the transfer of heat
                                            through convection to the fins of the heat sink, where it can then be
                                            redistributed with a fan.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv"><strong>Waterblock -</strong> The apparatus that attaches to the
                                            IHS when using an All-in-One (AIO) liquid cooler or a custom cooling loop.
                                            It transfers heat from the IHS to the heat transfer fluid, which then
                                            relocates that heat to be redistributed by fans at a radiator.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv"><strong>Thermal Paste -</strong> A silvery-gray substance that
                                            you apply to a processor before installing a cooling solution. It allows for
                                            an efficient transfer of heat from the IHS of the processor to the base
                                            plate or water block of the CPU cooler that is designed to dissipate that
                                            heat.</p>
