                                        GPU, but you can also overclock RAM (random access memory) to achieve faster
                                        speeds.</p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">The speed of RAM, measured in MHz, refers to its data transfer rate.
                                        The faster the data transfer rate, the better the RAM’s performance.
                                        Overclocking RAM involves modifying specific parameters such as timings and
                                        voltages to allow the modules to operate at greater speeds than they might out

                                            lower the other. Simply put, when a memory module operates at a high
                                            frequency, it is more difficult to keep it stable. To counter-balance
                                            stability challenges at high speeds, memory timings are often increased.
                                            This increases the time (latency) between operations, and helps to keep the
                                            transfer stable. Increased latency will reduce the performance and
                                            potentially eliminate the gains from a higher frequency, depending on the
                                            size of the frequency increase.

                                        <p class="V_pv ">Memory module manufacturers know this and carefully select
                                            memory chips for each stick, testing, and pairing memory modules that can
                                            reach the highest possible performance. This additional qualification and
                                            effort often results in a higher price, which is why low-latency, high-speed
                                            RAM tends to be more expensive.

                                            do this, like memtest86+ (which requires a boot disk), Aida64, MaxxMEM2, or
                                            Performance Test software. After running the benchmark of your choice, make

                                            using four 8GB modules. One way to reach higher overclocking performance
                                            would be to reduce our installed module count to two, as many motherboards
                                            have difficulty maintaining higher speeds as the load across the memory
                                            slots is increased.</p>

                                            fairly straightforward, and is similar to the process for overclocking a
                                            CPU. It involves carefully adjusting settings such as memory timings from
                                            the BIOS in order to find a combination that results in faster speeds,
                                            testing to see if the process was successful, and then trying again until
                                            you achieve the ideal balance of maximum stable frequency with the tightest
                                            timings.</p>

                                            following things in mind:
                                        </p>
                                        <ul class="v_pv mb-0">
                                            <li>To stabilize higher frequencies, you’ll want to increase (loosen) the
                                                timings. This may require increasing voltage as well.</li>
                                            <li>In order to increase performance when the current frequency is stable,
                                                you should reduce (tighten) the timings.</li>
                                            <li>If you are going for tighter timings, be sure to proceed methodically.
                                                With most motherboards, there are a wide array of timings that can be
                                                changed through the BIOS.</li>
                                            <li>Many BIOS utilities display the default timings. For instance, if your
                                                memory uses 15-15-36, you might want to try changing it to 14-14-34 as a
                                                first step.</li>
                                            <li>After experimenting with the memory timings, you might need to modify
                                                the memory input voltage. As with CPU overclocking, increasing the input
                                                voltage of a component will result in higher energy consumption and
                                                greater heat output.</li>
                                            <li>Memory voltage is a key ingredient to achieving a stable overclock. In a
                                                standard memory overclocking use case, consider 1.5V as a maximum, but
                                                aim for lower whenever possible. Be conservative with voltage changes,
                                                and keep them as low as possible when testing.</li>
                                            <li>Some motherboards do not support high-memory voltages, and consequently
                                                will not boot when you push the voltage too high. Try a lower voltage.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>When overclocking RAM, there is often a ceiling at which point pushing
                                                things higher will not yield additional performance gains. Once a
                                                certain frequency is achieved, further increases may not yield better
                                                performance because the motherboard automatically adjusts timings to
                                                keep the system stable. If you’re finding that you aren’t gaining
                                                additional performance after continued adjustment, it’s possible that
                                                you’ve reached the limits of what’s capable with your hardware.</li>
                                            <li>It might take a fair amount of experimentation until you find the right
                                                combination of frequencies, voltages, and timings for your hardware.

                                            <li>Make small, incremental changes to any settings, and test for stability
                                                between each attempt.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p class="V_pv">When you have modified the settings into a combination you
                                            believe might be successful, reboot back into Windows, and test by using a
                                            benchmark utility to verify stability and performance gains. If you want to
                                            keep trying for better performance, head back to BIOS and continue the
                                            testing process.

                                            better performance. It’s possible that many of your attempts will not be
                                            successful, and any changes you make will be lost after a failed trial.

                                            you from having to start over with every new attempt.
