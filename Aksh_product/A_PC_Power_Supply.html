                                        one could be costly.</p>

                                            like. The exact cables you’ll use will vary depending on the specifics of
                                            your build, but you’ll most likely be dealing with the following:
                                        </p>
                                        <ul class="V_pv">
                                            <li><strong>24-pin Motherboard: </strong>The way power is allocated varies
                                                from motherboard to motherboard, but the 24-pin connector/cable is
                                                frequently used to power important features such as the chipset and
                                                PCIe*</li>
                                            <li><strong>4/8-pin CPU: </strong>This connector provides power to your CPU.
                                                Modern CPUs draw more power than the 24-pin motherboard configuration
                                                can provide, which is why the additional 4/8 pin cable came into use.
                                                Though it can vary depending on the manufacturer, the CPU cable usually
                                                plugs into the top left side of the motherboard, near the I/O on a
                                                standard layout</li>
                                            <li><strong>6/8 pin (PCIe*/GPU): </strong>Some GPUs draw enough power from
                                                the PCIe* slot, while others require a specific power cable
                                                configuration to operate properly. Most PSUs address this required
                                                flexibility by providing cables that can be used in a variety of
                                                combinations, some of which include 6, 8, 6+6, 8+6, and 8+8, and even
                                                8+8+8 pin connectors. PSUs will often provide multiple connections on a
                                                single cable to avoid having to run additional wires, and for the vast
                                                majority of users, this will function the same as running multiple
                                                cables. Be sure to double-check that your power supply has the
                                                connections you need for your GPU before purchasing</li>
                                            <li><strong>SATA Power: </strong>This connector is used to provide power to
                                                SATA storage devices. Other devices have since adopted the standard as
                                                well, such as RGB hubs and fan controllers. Many PSUs have multiple SATA
                                                connections on one cable to reduce the amount of cables required</li>
                                            <li><strong>4-pin Molex</strong>: This is an increasingly rare legacy
                                                connector that has mostly been replaced by SATA. Molex connectors are
                                                usually found on less common accessories, such as water cooling pumps

                                            system.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Generally, more complex systems require more power to run. A
                                            desktop with a custom liquid cooling loop, a high-end motherboard, and dual
                                            GPUs is going to need a higher wattage computer power supply than a simpler
                                            system.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">It’s impossible to give an exact recommendation without knowing
                                            specifically what hardware you’re working with, but using a <a href="#"
                                                class="V_andecor_r">PSU Wattage Calculator</a>, or determining the power
                                            draw of your different internal components and adding that together, can
                                            give insight into how many watts you need.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">As a general rule, it’s better to err on the side of higher
                                            wattage rather than trying to match your needs exactly. If you’ve calculated
                                            that your system is going to use 500 watts (a common number for a
                                            straightforward gaming build), choosing a PSU with 600 or 650-watt output
                                            could be a good option, as it will give you some overhead to work with, and
                                            also allow for potential future upgrades.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Keep this in mind when considering higher wattage PSUs: a
                                            750-watt power supply does not consume 750 watts by default. If your system
                                            is drawing 500 watts, your power supply will supply 500 watts, regardless of
                                            maximum capable output. Higher wattage output doesn’t necessarily mean more
                                            energy consumed; it means it has the ability to provide more power if your
                                            system demands it. That said, there’s no real advantage to having a vastly
                                            overpowered PSU if your system doesn’t need it, so you might be better
                                            served selecting a feature-rich, high-efficiency PSU that is closer to the
                                            wattage you require.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">You’ll also want to consider the continuous power versus the
                                            peak power capabilities of your new PSU. Peak power is the maximum amount of
                                            power the PSU can output for short periods of time, whereas continuous power
                                            refers to the amount of power the PSU is designed to output on a regular
                                            basis. Peak power is usually reached when pushing your system to its limits,
                                            like when you’re running demanding games or performing hardware benchmarks.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">If there is a sudden demand for more power, your PSU should be
                                            able to handle the higher output briefly, but should not be expected to run
                                            at those higher wattages continuously. Always make sure the PSU you purchase
                                            has sufficiently high continuous power output, and don’t choose solely by
                                            peak power capabilities.</p>

                                            of power, system safety is a concern. A good power supply should have
                                            fail-safes built in — not just to protect the PSU itself, but also to keep
                                            your system safe in case of something unexpected, like a power surge.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">The power supply and the motherboard are the only PC components
                                            that directly connect to almost every other piece of hardware in your
                                            system. Because of the unique position of the PSU in the PC’s layout, making
                                            sure it has built-in protection can help keep the rest of your hardware safe
                                            as well.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">It’s worth noting whether the power supply you’re looking at has
                                            built-in protection, like OVP (Over Voltage Protection), which shuts down
                                            the PSU if excessive voltage is detected. Other safety features include
                                            functions like short circuit protection, which can be hugely beneficial if
                                            you encounter power fluctuations.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">You’ll also want to plug in your PC to a surge protector. These
                                            hardware-saving devices are designed to add another layer of protection to
                                            your system by diverting potentially damaging power surges away from your

                                                choosing a desktop power supply, but so is PSU efficiency. Inefficient
                                                delivery leads to wasted power and more heat, which can potentially
                                                decrease the lifespan of your components.</p>

                                                rating on many power supplies, often listed alongside a precious metal.
                                                To receive this rating, a power supply must be at least 80 percent
                                                efficient, meaning that a maximum of 20 percent of power is lost as

                                                physical attributes of your PSU is whether it’s modular or non-modular.
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="V_pv ">A power supply operates by converting energy from a wall
                                                socket and routing that power to each of the individual components in
                                                your system through a variety of cables. If your power supply is
                                                non-modular, these cables will already be soldered to the circuit board,
                                                meaning you don’t get to choose the cables that will be in your build.
                                                All the cabling, even the ones that you don’t use, will need to be
                                                stored in your case.
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="V_pv ">There’s nothing inherently wrong with this from a
                                                functional perspective, though poor cable management can lead to less
                                                efficient airflow, so you’ll want to be sure those extra cables don’t
                                                get in the way.
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="V_pv">Modular power supplies, on the other hand, don’t come with
                                                the cables attached. This changes the installation process, as you’ll
                                                need to connect each cable to the PSU and the component that it is
                                                powering, but that also means you can optimize for fewer cables. This
                                                results in a cleaner build and potentially better airflow. Most people
                                                aren’t going to use every connector provided by the average power
                                                supply, which makes modular units a little more practical, as well.
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="V_pv ">There’s also a third, in-between option, creatively called
                                                a semi-modular power supply. These are exactly what they sound like:
                                                Some of the most frequently used cables are attached to the PSU, while
                                                some you’ll have to connect yourself.
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="V_pv ">For modular and semi-modular power systems, keep in mind
                                                that you do not want to mix and match cables from other manufacturers,
                                                or even different models from the same manufacturer, unless stated
                                                otherwise. Though the cable-ends that connect to the components in your
                                                build are standardized, the end that connects to the PSU isn’t, meaning
                                                different brands could have different connections. That’s why you should
                                                only use the cables that came with your power supply.

                                                are no exception. In addition to everything we’ve discussed, there are a

                                                buttons, and power draw measurements via internal USB connections are
                                                luxuries more than necessities, but they are options if you’re
