                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5">What Is Hardware-Based Security?</h3>
                        <p>Security capabilities physically built in at the silicon level are defined as being
                            hardware-based. This differs from traditional software-based protections in which security
                            measures are installed on top of hardware, leaving the layers located below the operating
                            system (OS) vulnerable to a rising class of attacks.</p>
                        <p>Hardware-based security protection is not intended to replace software security options but
                            rather complement them. This creates a multidimensional and comprehensive security approach
                            that can both detect and prevent a greater range of cyberthreats in today’s increasingly
                            complex and dispersed workplace environments.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5">Why Software-Based Security Is No Longer Enough</h3>
                        <p>Businesses have traditionally relied on security software to protect their assets. But
                            today’s attacks are changing and shifting toward applications and devices below the
                            operating system. This means software-based security can be bypassed by an attacker who is
                            sophisticated or skilled enough to find and exploit a vulnerability in firmware or hardware.
                        </p>
                        <p>For example, an emerging area of vulnerability is the code in device firmware that runs at
                            startup to prepare the OS launch. Hackers look for ways to inject malware into this code
                            beneath the operating system, which by default never required security and integrity checks
                            designed into its sequence. As a result, the OS will trust this code even when it contains a
                            nefarious malware payload.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1"><a href="#">Hardware-based security</a>&nbsp;capabilities
                            built in at the silicon level can help to create a trusted foundation that better secures
                            data, maintains device integrity, and ensures systems start and operate as intended.</p>
                        <h3>Device Tampering</h3>
                        <p>Device tampering is another malware intrusion below the OS that can be addressed with
                            hardware-based security features. Tampering can occur anywhere in the manufacture to
                            delivery process. To counter tampering, investing in a modern device that integrates
                            hardware security capabilities at the assembly line, via the processor, and offers OS
                            security capabilities right out of box is imperative.</p>
                        <p>IT can also determine whether a newly received device has been tampered with by researching
                            if the manufacturer ensures the authenticity of certified device components and takes
                            baseline measurements of firmware code, also known as golden measurements, before the
                            firmware is sealed, prior to transport and delivery.</p>
                        <p>After delivery, hardware-based security helps mitigate the risk of device tampering that can
                            occur at any time in the asset’s life cycle. For example, with Intel-based processors, at
                            each startup the technology verifies the loaders that boot the code and execute the boot
                            sequence of the firmware and operating system. This added layer of security helps mitigate
                            the risk of tampering to introduce malicious code under the operating system.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5">Hardware Security Strategies for the Business Environment</h3>
                        <p>Hardware-enabled security should play a significant role in your business’s overall
                            comprehensive security plan. Consider the following strategies to help ensure all facets of
                            your business environment are protected.</p>
                        <h3>Keep All Layers of Your Endpoints Secured</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Security threats start at the endpoint, and your PC fleet
                            endpoints are prime targets for hackers. The increase in employees working from anywhere has
                            only made <a href="#">securing your endpoints</a>&nbsp;more difficult. To better protect all
                            layers of your endpoint devices and mitigate the risks of a dispersed fleet, seek out
                            devices on Intel vPro® that have unique hardware-based security features enabled right out
                            of the box, including active monitoring for attacks. <a href="#">Discover the return you
                                could see from deploying hardware-enabled endpoint security</a>.</p>
                        <h3>Enhance Virtualization Security with Depth-of-Defense Protections</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Another security approach that businesses are implementing is
                            virtualization security, in which virtualized containers can be used to isolate and verify
                            the integrity of applications, web browsers, and data running inside those containerized
                            environments. <a href="#">Virtualization</a>&nbsp;provides the ability to offer protection
                            through isolation. It also minimizes what malware can do on the system, as the virtualized
                            workspace has limited access to system resources and lacks the ability to persist on the
                            system.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">However, like software-based security options, virtualization
                            security can benefit from extra layers of protection provided by hardware-based security
                            capabilities. Intel offers a full portfolio of technologies and features that provide

                        <h3>Trusted Platform Module for Windows 11 Security</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">To keep PCs secure and make it harder for hackers to commit
                            cybercrimes, Windows 11 now requires all PCs to use trusted platform module (TPM) 2.0 to
                            operate. <a href="#">TPM</a>&nbsp;is a security chip that is part of your computer’s
                            motherboard and helps to keep it secure by offering hardware-level protection against
                            malware and sophisticated cyberattacks. Using cryptography, TPM securely stores essential
                            and critical information on PCs to enable platform authentication. Ensuring your devices are
                            equipped with TPM 2.0 is imperative for the longevity of your fleet, as it will become a
                            standard for future upgrades, and devices without TPM 2.0 will run the risk of outdated
                            security protections.</p>

                                Intel® Core™ Processor family</a>&nbsp;support TPM 2.0 through <a href="#">Intel®
                                Platform Trust Technology (Intel® PTT)</a>, an integrated TPM that adheres to the 2.0
                            specifications. Intel® PTT offers the same capabilities of a discrete TPM, only it resides
                            in the system’s firmware, thus removing the need for dedicated processing or memory
                            resources.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">However, even if your computer supports TPM 2.0, it still may
                            be time to refresh your PC, as older PCs can leave you more vulnerable to cyberattacks. <a
