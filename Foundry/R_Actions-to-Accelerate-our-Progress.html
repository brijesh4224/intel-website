                                    company’s transformation plan.</em></p>
                            <p>Team,</p>
                            <p>We have moved our All Company Meeting to today, following our earnings call, as we are
                                <a href="" style="color: #0068B5;" class="r_border">announcing significant actions to
                                    reduce our costs</a>. We plan to deliver $10 billion in
                                cost savings in 2025, and this includes reducing our head count by roughly 15,000 roles,
                                or 15% of our workforce. The majority of these actions will be completed by the end of
                                this year.
                            </p>
                            <p>This is painful news for me to share. I know it will be even more difficult for you to
                                read. This is an incredibly hard day for Intel as we are making some of the most
                                consequential changes in our company’s history. When we meet in a few hours, I’ll talk
                                about why we’re doing this and what you can expect in the coming weeks. In advance of
                                that, I wanted to preview some of what’s on my mind.</p>
                            <p>Simply put, we must align our cost structure with our new operating model and
                                fundamentally change the way we operate. Our revenues have not grown as expected – and
                                we’ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI. Our costs are too high, our
                                margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both – particularly given our
                                financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is tougher than
                                previously expected.</p>
                            <p>These decisions have challenged me to my core, and this is the hardest thing I’ve done in
                                my career. My pledge to you is that we will prioritize a culture of honesty,
                                transparency and respect in the weeks and months to come.</p>
                            <p>Next week, we’ll announce a companywide enhanced retirement offering for eligible
                                employees and broadly offer an application program for voluntary departures. I believe
                                that how we implement these changes is just as important as the changes themselves, and
                                we will adhere to Intel values throughout this process.</p>
                            <p><strong>Why Now?</strong></p>
                            <p>Since introducing our new operating model, we have taken a clean-sheet view of the
                                business and assessed ourselves against benchmarks for high-performing foundries,
                                fabless product companies and corporate functions. This work made it clear our cost
                                structure is not competitive.</p>
                            <p>For example, our annual revenue in 2020 was about $24 billion higher than it was last
                                year, yet our current workforce is actually 10% larger now than it was then. There are a
                                lot of reasons for this, but it’s not a sustainable path forward.</p>
                            <p>Beyond our costs, we need to change the way we operate – something many of you shared as
                                part of our Employee Experience Survey. There’s too much complexity, so we need to both
                                automate and simplify processes. It takes too long for decisions to be made, so we need
                                to eliminate bureaucracy. And there’s too much inefficiency in the system, so we need to
                                expedite workflows.</p>
                            <p><strong>Key Priorities</strong></p>
                            <p>The actions we are taking will make Intel a leaner, simpler and more agile company. Let
                                me highlight our areas of focus:</p>
                            <ul class="r_liststyke">
                                <li><strong>Reducing Operational Costs: </strong>We will drive companywide operational
                                    and cost efficiencies, including the cost savings and head count reductions
                                    mentioned above.</li>
                                <li><strong>Simplifying Our Portfolio: </strong>We will complete actions this month to
                                    simplify our businesses. Each business unit is conducting a portfolio review and
                                    identifying underperforming products. We are also integrating key software assets
                                    into our business units so we accelerate our shift to systems-based solutions. And
                                    we will narrow our incubation focus on fewer, more impactful projects.</li>
                                <li><strong>Eliminating Complexity: </strong>We will reduce layers, eliminate
                                    overlapping areas of responsibility, stop non-essential work, and foster a culture
                                    of greater ownership and accountability. For example, we will consolidate Customer
                                    Success into the Sales, Marketing and Communications Group to streamline our
                                    go-to-market motions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reducing Capital and Other Costs:</strong>With the completion of our
                                    historic five-nodes-in-four-years roadmap clearly in sight, we will review all
                                    active projects and equipment so we begin to shift our focus toward capital
                                    efficiency and more normalized spending levels. This will reduce our 2024 capital
                                    expenditures by more than 20%, and we plan to reduce our non-variable cost of goods
                                    sold by roughly $1 billion in 2025.</li>
                                <li><strong>Suspending Our Dividend: </strong>We will suspend our stock dividend
                                    beginning next quarter to prioritize investments in the business and drive more
                                    sustained profitability.</li>
                                <li><strong>Maintaining Growth Investments: </strong>Our IDM2.0 strategy is unchanged.
                                    Having fought hard to reestablish our innovation engine, we will maintain the key
                                    investments in our process technology and core product leadership.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>The Future</strong></p>
                            <p>I have no illusions that the path in front of us will be easy. You shouldn’t either. This
                                is a tough day for all of us and there will be more tough days ahead. But as difficult
                                as all of this is, we are making the changes necessary to build on our progress and
                                usher in a new era of growth.</p>
                            <p>When we began this journey, we set our sights high, knowing that Intel is a place where
                                big ideas are born and the power of what’s possible triumphs over the status quo. After
                                all, our mission is to create world-changing technologies that improve the lives of
                                every person on the planet. And at our best, we have exemplified these ideals more than
                                any company in the world.</p>
                            <p>To live up to this mission, we must continue to drive our IDM 2.0 strategy, which remains
                                the same: re-establish process technology leadership; invest in at-scale, globally
                                resilient supply chain by expanding manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and EU; become a
                                world-class, leading-edge foundry for internal and external customers; rebuild product
                                portfolio leadership; and deliver AI Everywhere.</p>
                            <p>Over the past few years, we have rebuilt a sustainable innovation engine that is largely
                                in place and on track. It’s now time to focus on building the sustainable financial
                                engine needed to drive our performance. We must improve our execution, adapt to new
                                market realities and operate as a more agile company. That’s the spirit of the actions
                                we are taking – knowing that the choices we make today, as difficult as they are, will
                                strengthen our ability to serve our customers and grow our business for years to come.
                            </p>
                            <p>As we take these next steps in our journey, let’s not forget that there has never been a
                                greater need for what we do. The world will increasingly run on silicon – and the world
                                needs a healthy and vibrant Intel. That’s why the work we are doing is so consequential.
                                Not only are we remaking a great company, but we are also creating technology and
                                manufacturing capabilities that will reshape the world for decades to come. And this is
                                something we should never lose sight of as we push forward in pursuit of our goals.</p>
                            <p>We’ll talk more in a few hours. Please come with your questions so we can have an open and honest discussion about what comes next.</p>
