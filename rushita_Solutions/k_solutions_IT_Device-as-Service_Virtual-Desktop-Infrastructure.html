                        <h3 class="mt-5 pt-4 fw-light">What Is Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)?</h3>
                        <p>VDI refers to abstracting and hosting numerous virtualized desktop sessions on a centralized,
                            back-end server. These virtual desktops are then made accessible to users through thin
                            client endpoints. (Thin client devices are typically cost-efficient PCs with minimal
                            hardware, designed for one task or a few functions.) VDI has been around for over a decade
                            and is a common method of providing a high number of repeatable endpoint experiences to a
                            large workforce.&nbsp;Global disruptions such as COVID-19 mean that businesses need to be
                            ready to support a massive remote workforce at short notice, and many IT decision-makers are
                            looking with renewed interest at VDI as a potential solution to abstract the entire desktop
                            or a subset of its applications.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 fw-light">How Does VDI Work?</h3>
                        <p>In a VDI configuration, a central server hosts the entirety of the virtual desktop, including
                            OS and apps. The server uses remote procedure call (RPC), a series of functions that
                            facilitate communication to and from end clients. System administrators use an RPC
                            orchestrator on the server to configure the virtualized desktop environments, select which
                            apps are available, and establish settings and permissions for the operating system (OS).
                            End users will then individually connect to the server and access a virtualized desktop
                            environment through their client PC. Usually, the endpoints in a VDI configuration will be
                            thin clients, which are PCs with an ultralightweight configuration: just enough processor
                            speed and RAM to perform a few functions, built for a closed corporate LAN network.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">However, as the VDI model is evolving, new configurations are
                            exploring the potential for supporting VDI over the cloud to PCs and rich end clients
                            outside the corporate firewall. A key example of this is Windows Virtual Desktop, which
                            Microsoft supports through the Azure cloud service. Windows Virtual Desktop provides a full
                            Windows 10 experience with Microsoft 365 apps, enabling more variety in productivity or
                            interactivity compared to traditional VDI with stationary thin clients. Accordingly, the end
                            user device for a Windows Virtual Desktop setup may offer a full PC or laptop experience
                            with more-robust specifications, including a faster processor, Wi-Fi, and integrated
                            graphics. Microsoft also hosts the infrastructure for <a href="#">Windows Virtual
                                Desktop</a>, so businesses donât need to invest in or manage server infrastructure to
                            support the solution. Businesses can be up and running faster, and they spend less on
                            maintenance and overhead.<br>

                        <p>There are categories of VDI deployments known as âpersistent deploymentsâ and ânonpersistent
                            deployments.â Persistent VDI refers to VDI configurations that preserve end user settings
                            and files each time the user logs out or shuts down their PC. Nonpersistent VDI locks down
                            the virtual desktop such that any changes introduced by the end user are discarded at the
                            end of each session. Saved files are wiped clean, configuration settings are reverted to
                            default, and any unintentional change like downloaded malware is erased. Nonpersistent VDI
                            can be used in an environment where endpoint PCs and terminals are publicly shared and there
                            is no need to preserve user profiles from one login instance to the next.</p>

                        <p>Desktop virtualization is a method that allows workers to remotely access and run
                            applications on a desktop workspace from a separate device. A common scenario is when a
                            worker logs into their office PC from their home PC using remote access software. Desktop
                            virtualization may also refer to running multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single device
                            in order to keep workloads separate and isolated. A common example of desktop virtualization
                            is when a worker runs two separate VMs on their PC: one VM for professional and business use
                            and one VM for personal use.</p>
                        <p>VDI is different from desktop virtualization in that desktop virtualization is decentralized.
                            It generally refers to accessing or managing VMs between one or more devices. VDI is a
                            centrally managed, locked-down environment where all virtual desktops are hosted on a
                            back-end server.</p>
                        <h3 class="mt-5 fw-light">VDI Use Cases</h3>
                        <p>VDI can be useful to any industry that is looking to implement a highly repeatable end user
                            experience at scale. Here are a few key examples:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Banking and financial institutions:</b> VDI allows banks to tightly control what
                                information their endpoint systems can access. This level of control makes it easier to
                                handle sensitive financial transactions under a heavily scrutinized and regulated
                                environment.</li>
                            <li><b>Hospitals and healthcare environments:</b> Hospitals also handle confidential
                                information and must abide by complex regulations such as HIPAA in the United States.
                                Additionally, nurses and doctors are highly mobile in a healthcare environment, moving
                                from thin client to thin client throughout the workday. A VDI implementation allows
                                users to cycle in and out of different profiles on the same device while keeping
                                information siloed and helping meet privacy requirements. VDI can also offer
                                context-specific access methods, like two-factor authentication or badge swiping, to
                                help secure and track user access from terminal to terminal.</li>
                            <li><b>Call centers:</b> Call centers benefit greatly from lightweight, cost-effective
                                endpoints for their workers. In these business environments, PCs typically only need to
                                run a single app for call routing and response. VDI servers help simplify management
                                requirements with a centralized point of control. The result is that call-center
                                businesses can scale up their workforce and strike a balance between capacity and
                                efficiency.</li>
                            <li><b>Remote access:</b> Remote workforces are increasingly becoming the norm. However,
                                remote workers need more flexibility and performance in their endpoint PCs to support
                                modern work practices: email, web browsing, word processing, and videoconferences. In
                                these cases, businesses need a rich client experience and full desktop capabilities,
                                such as those found in Windows Virtual Desktop.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="mt-5 fw-light">Benefits of VDI</h3>
                        <p>VDI is useful in any scenario where an organization needs to lock down company data or limit
                            end user functions to a singular purpose or mode of productivity. The following is a list of
                            benefits in a traditional VDI use case, but as previously stated, the model is evolving to
                            accommodate richer remote online experiences.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Centralized management:</b> Because VDI servers are centrally controlled, itâs easier
                                for a system administrator to maintain, update, or deploy new apps through the RPC
                                orchestrator. As a result, administrators do not need to update end user devices
                                individually.</li>
                            <li><b>More-secure data:</b> In a VDI setup, nothing is stored locally on the endpoint
                                device. All data and apps remain on the server, so it is easy for a company to lock down
                                its data and help protect it from unauthorized access.</li>
                            <li><b>Congruent user experiences:</b> The VDI experience is the same for every end user who
                                logs into a virtualized desktop: the same apps, the same OS settings, the same
                                permissions.</li>
                            <li><b>Cost-effective endpoints:</b> Because endpoints in a VDI implementation are designed
                                to fulfill just one or a few functions, the endpoint devices themselves can be very
                                stripped-down, lightweight, low-cost configurations. (This scenario does not typically
                                apply when using rich clients and a hosted virtual desktop solution like Windows Virtual
                                Desktop.)</li>
                            <li><b>Highly customizable:</b> VDI implementations leave it up to the business to decide
                                which apps should be installed on the endpoint devices. Perhaps workers need access to a
                                SaaS-based HR software, so companies might then include browser functionality to open
                                endpoints up to the rest of the world.</li>
                            <li><b>Extend legacy investments:</b> VDI is also a viable option anytime a business needs
                                to use software beyond its official end of life. For example, if a business has a legacy
                                app that only runs in Windows 7, the business can set up a VDI environment thatâs
                                tightly controlled and not exposed to external network access.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="mt-5 fw-light">VDI Technology Requirements</h3>
                        <p>Traditional VDI implementations are composed of one or more central servers and a number of
                            lightweight endpoint devices. However, as workloads and multitasking are increasing in
                            volume and scope, endpoints need to become more robust and offer richer end user
                            experiences.</p>
                        <p>The challenge with deploying rich clients in a VDI environment is that the more capabilities
                            you add to an endpoint device, the harder it is to manage centrally and the more expensive
                            it gets. This is especially true when you take endpoint devices outside the corporate
                            firewall. As more and more businesses are turning to VDI and solutions like Windows Virtual
                            Desktop to equip and enable their remote workforces, there is a greater need for remote
                            manageability platforms to make it easier to access and secure these devices.</p>
