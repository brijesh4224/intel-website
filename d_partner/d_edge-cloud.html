                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">What Is the Edge Cloud?</h2>
                            <p>Cloud computing has brought incredible transformation to businesses of all sizes. Today,
                                enterprises are augmenting cloud computing with edge computing for certain types of
                                workloads, such as latency-sensitive applications.
                            </p>
                            <p>Edge cloud computing extends the convenience of the cloud to edge networks. Edge clouds
                                are hosted by micro-data centers that store, analyze, and process data faster than is
                                possible using a connection to a data center.

                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Edge Cloud and Data Centers</h2>
                            <p>Typically, cloud services run on large-scale data centers. These may be private clouds
                                hosted by on-premises infrastructure or public cloud services from providers such as
                                Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure.</p>
                            <p>While cloud computing excels in resource-intensive data processing and workloads like AI
                                training, it creates issues with latency for some workloads as data must travel all the
                                way to the data center and back again. In many cases, businesses can achieve real-time
                                intelligence with edge computing.</p>
                            <p>An edge cloud strategy places intelligent edge nodes closer to local resources,
                                equipment, and devices, with software to deliver services in a way that’s similar to
                                using public cloud services.</p>
                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Benefits of an Edge Cloud</h2>

                                accommodate them, cloud and communication service providers are shifting workloads to

                            <p>Edge servers act as micro-data centers, delivering the computing power for an edge cloud.
                            </p>
                            <p>While they often look like a typical server, many other form factors exist. For example,
                                a ruggedized laptop, a purpose-built appliance, or a robust edge device featuring
                                onboard intelligence can perform as an edge server.</p>
                            <p><b>Edge Servers vs. Origin Servers</b></p>
                            <p>For business models that involve streamed content, like music, video, or interactive

                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Edge Network Architecture</h2>
                            <p>Edge network deployments can involve multiple layers, different server security
                                approaches, and various edge devices optimized for specific needs.</p>
                            <p>In practice, endpoint devices like smart cameras serve as a “front line” for edge
                                computing, residing as physically close as possible to the users, equipment, or business
                                process they serve. Edge servers and origin servers offer a secondary layer for edge
                                computing. They function as an intermediary between localized systems and centralized
                                business resources. A primary data center operates as another layer, residing furthest
                                away from physical endpoints.</p>
                            <p>By placing computing at the right layer, companies can make the best use of their
                                resources and design more successful Internet of Things (IoT) strategies. Take, for
                                example, a digital security system. Smart cameras at the edge can detect movement in
                                real time and trigger an alert; a nearby edge server can process the data and determine
                                whether the movement poses a threat; and the cloud can collect and analyze data over the
                                long term to help businesses understand environmental patterns.</p>

                            <p>Edge deployments—and the connected devices associated with them—must protect business and
                                customer data. Security breaches can compromise sensitive data and put trade secrets or
                                other proprietary corporate information at risk. They can interrupt business processes
                                or
                                even halt operations entirely. Data breaches can also result in costly fines and erode a
                                customer’s trust in a business.</p>
                            <p>Intel’s products offer silicon-enabled security technologies that help protect potential
                                attack surfaces.1 These technologies help create a trusted foundation with product lines

                                security, businesses can benefit from simplified deployment and integration.</p>
