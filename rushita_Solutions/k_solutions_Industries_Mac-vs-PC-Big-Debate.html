                                When you’re choosing between a PC or Mac*, it’s important to understand how key
                                differences and features will affect your productivity and creativity. This article
                                covers the key considerations to keep in mind as you decide which device is right for
                                you.

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4" id="key1">Should You Get a PC or a Mac? What to Consider</h3>
                        <p>Say your computer died today, right now, with no warning. If you wanted to buy a new one,
                            would you know what you wanted, or would you try to find something better? The first
                            question you may ask—like many others when buying a new computer—is, “Should I get a PC or a
                            Mac?” However, before you take a step into a retail store for a new device, it’s important
                            to do some research on Macs (by Apple*) and PCs (personal computers).</p>
                        <p>To get started, think about what sort of capabilities and choices you’d like in a device and
                            how you use your computer:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Are you multitasking during the day, jumping between videoconferences and office tools?
                            </li>
                            <li>Do you need a device that can keep up with your design applications for a 3D printer?
                            </li>
                            <li>Are you a frequent traveler, relying on your device to connect with family or coworkers
                                on the go?</li>
                            <li>Do you like to game with your friends or have a side gig creating tunes as a freelance
                                musician?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These are just a small handful of tasks, responsibilities, and recreational activities, but the bottom line is this: If you use your computer on a daily basis for work, entertainment, or everything in between, a PC can give you the choice to do it all.</p>
                        <p>Even without extra fancy features and add-ons, Intel-based PCs provide outstanding performance, connectivity, enhanced security, and graphics. But most importantly, PCs give you a wider sense of choice, coming in a variety of form factors while also giving you access to a broader selection of software and accessory choices. Especially when powered by Intel® processors and graphics, PCs can be a great option for you if you rely on your device for everyday use.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Form Factor and Device Types</h3>
                        <p>One important consideration is what type of device, or form factor, you want: a laptop, tablet, desktop, or 2-in-1. PCs give you the option to select your device’s screen size, resolution, thinness, touchscreen capabilities, port types, and color. When you have the chance to customize your PC, you’ll be able to choose a device that fits your needs without having to worry about what you <em>aren’t </em>getting out of that device.</p>
                        <p>Macs<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;tend to offer a limited set of form factors and out-of-the box accessory options compared to PCs. For example, if you’re looking for a device with touchscreen capabilities and a stylus, your only Apple option is a tablet, as Apple does not currently offer a laptop with a touchscreen.<sup>2</sup><br>
                            And, while Apple tablets support an Apple Pencil, it must be purchased separately.<sup>3</sup> Think you might want a keyboard? That’s extra too.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, a 2-in-1 PC comes with touchscreen capabilities, it can be used as both a laptop and a tablet, and the stylus is included. That’s one PC device with the capabilities you need right out of the box.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Device Performance</h3>
                        <p>Nothing is more irritating than the spinning wheel of death when you’re trying to get something done. Having a device that is configured to provide the right level of performance can make all the difference between finishing your work and winning a game or suffering from lag and being blocked altogether. Owning a PC means you can have peace of mind, and with Intel® processors, you can customize your PC to get a range of possibilities and options that can support your workloads.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Intel-based PCs are designed to keep up with a fast-paced consumer lifestyle, offering fast connections and response times when enabled with&nbsp;<a href="#">Intel® Wi-Fi 6E (Gig+)</a>&nbsp;and <a href="#">Thunderbolt™ 4</a>. That means if you’re looking for a sleek, lightweight device that enables reliable network and high-speed connectivity, <a href="#">Intel® Evo™ platform-based laptops</a>&nbsp;are a great choice. These remarkable devices, engineered specifically to meet consumer needs, also come with the latest <a href="#">Intel® Core™ processors</a>&nbsp;and <a href="#">Intel® Iris® Xᵉ graphics</a>&nbsp;for powerful performance and dynamic graphics.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Price</h3>
                        <p>The next consideration—as if you haven’t thought about it already—is price. Comparing prices between PCs and the latest Macs is difficult because they usually have different preinstalled software and configurations. As you think about how you use your device, it’s important to evaluate whether a device has all the capabilities you’re looking for or if extra peripheral devices may be required.</p>
                        <p>With PCs, you have more choice when it comes to the system configuration that works best for you, and you’re likely to get the most out of what you pay for. If you’re looking for more memory and storage options, enhanced security, fast response times, and great performance, a PC is going to provide that right off the bat, giving you more for your investment. The latest Macs<sup>1</sup> are likely to require you to buy add-ons that will quickly start to add up.</p>
                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Device Ecosystem</h3>
                        <p>In our multifaceted lives, we need our devices to seamlessly flex along with us as we shift from one activity to the next.</p>
                        <p>Do you plan on connecting an external monitor, keyboard, mouse, or USB-connected device when gaming or working at home? A camera or other peripherals for photo or audio editing? When choosing a device, you want to make sure not only that it comes with the types of connection ports you need, but that it can also support the external devices and software programs you want to use.</p>
                        <p>Apple produces its own hardware and operating system, meaning the two are designed to work together seamlessly; however, this also means that while its own products work well together, you may be limited in what non-Apple products and software programs you can access.</p>
                        <p>Conversely, because PCs offer you a broad range of device options, you can select one with the built-in features, ports, and connectivity capabilities that fit how you plan to use your computer. And, since PCs are built to support an open ecosystem, you have the ability to use a greater number of applications and external devices, giving you access to even more features you want.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Security</h3>
                        <p>Having a great device will mean close to nothing if you get hacked. That’s why it’s critical to look for devices with layers of security features, defense capabilities, and support to help build resilience against viruses and cyberattacks that continue to increase in number and sophistication.</p>
                        <p>According to Malwarebytes’ <a href="#" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline">2022 Threat Review</a>, detection of malicious software attacks increased by 77 percent in 2021 compared to the previous year, and detection of adware, spyware, and worms increased 200 percent in that same time frame.<sup>4</sup></p>
                        <p>When looking at Macs vs. Windows-based machines, Malwarebytes saw the volume of security threats for Mac endpoints in 2021 increase more than 200 percent year over year, while the number of attacks on Windows endpoints increased by 65 percent in the same time frame.<sup>2</sup></p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Combatting today’s threats requires a multilevel approach to protecting your device that software alone cannot offer. If you’re looking to keep your data safe, an Intel-powered PC is going to be a better bet. <a href="#">Intel takes a comprehensive approach to security with a commitment to using the industry’s best security practices</a>.<a href="#"> </a>Additionally, PCs with <a href="#">Windows 11</a>&nbsp;benefit from several new integrated Windows security features to help further protect your device.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Gaming</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">With PCs supporting more external devices with a greater variety of form factors, it’s no wonder that gamers choose PCs for running, downloading, or streaming games. No matter if you’re a casual or competitive gamer, most online and console&nbsp;<a href="#">games</a>&nbsp;are only compatible with PCs.</p>
                        <p>Would you like to play <em>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em> or <em>Overwatch</em> with friends? What about <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, <em>PUBG</em>, or <em>Apex Legends</em>? If you own a Mac, you’ll likely have to borrow a friend’s PC or download additional software (which could be prone to more crashes), or else you’ll end up sitting out altogether. With a severely limited library of Steam games, recent Mac operating systems can’t support hundreds of games, leaving Mac users behind.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">With the latest Intel® Core™ processors for gaming, you have the power to stream, create, and <a href="#">compete at the highest level</a>.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">For more information on choosing a PC for gaming, <a href="#">check out our Intel® gaming expert’s recommendations</a>.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Content Creation</h3>
                        <p>Listen up if you’re a content creator! PCs are known for supporting a diverse array of applications and being compatible across the plugins and applications that creators use every day. Whether you’re an artist, musician, or video influencer, a PC will allow you to continue using the applications and plugins you need—from music creation apps such as Ableton, Serato, and Avid Pro Tools to workstation applications like Barracuda VPN, VMware Fusion, and Box Drive.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Dive deeper into <a href="#">Intel-based PCs, laptops, and technology built for specific types of creative work</a>.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Choose the Device That Fits You the Best</h3>
                        <p>Ultimately, each system has unique advantages and disadvantages. Determining which device is best for your productivity and creativity comes down to how you use your device and how much flexibility you want in various feature options. Above all, remember to choose your device based on the experience you want to have every day.</p>
