                        <p>Just as IT has been the lynchpin of digital transformation, technologists will also be
                            equally critical leaders in sustainable transformation.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>To reach </strong><strong>tech zero,</strong> or diminish the carbon footprint
                                of an organization’s IT function by optimizing operations to reduce waste and
                                inefficiencies in existing processes.</li>
                            <li><strong>To become </strong><strong>tech positive</strong>, meaning using technology as a
                                lever for the whole organization to reach its net zero goals and to drive new value and
                                differentiation for a positive overall impact.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3><strong>Measuring Organizational Progress Toward Sustainability</strong></h3>
                        <p>Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data can help enterprises operate responsibly and
                            contribute to a more sustainable future. The IT team can help gather related data, which
                            enables investors, stakeholders, and ESG rating agencies to assess an organization’s
                            performance relative to responsible sustainability practices and long-term value creation.
                        </p>
                        <p>The following are factors that contribute to the measurement of a business’s sustainability
                            impacts:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Environmental</strong>: Carbon emissions, energy consumption, water usage, waste
                                management, and efforts to reduce environmental footprint.</li>
                            <li><strong>Social</strong>: Commitment to diversity, labor practices, employee turnover
                                rates, and impact on local communities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Governance</strong>: Board diversity and executive compensation, risk profile,
                                long-term viability, accountability for ESG business practices, and compliance with
                                regulations.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>One appealing benefit for ESG-savvy organizations is that, as a company’s ESG score improves,
                            its capital costs reduce, which, in turn, improves the company’s valuation.</p>
                        <h3><strong>Responsible AI</strong></h3>
                        <p>As with most emergent technologies, there are challenges to implementing and using AI.
                            Decision-makers should be aware of data security and privacy risks, computational resourcing
                            and expense, and ethical and societal implications. As a foundation for all uses of AI for
                            sustainability, there must be a commitment to using <a

                                and improvements to increase operational and resource efficiency. Additionally, AI can
                                support transparency around ESG goals and progress to help meet disclosure requirements,
                                increase data-driven decision-making, and improve carbon calculation across the value
                                chain, which can, in turn, help identify opportunities for improvement and adaptability.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Accelerate the development of sustainability
                                    solutions:&nbsp;</strong>Enterprises can leverage AI to help drive innovation and

                                development with new, environmentally friendly materials, enterprises can expedite the
                                development of more sustainable products.</li>
                            <li><strong>Respond and adjust to climate impacts:&nbsp;</strong>AI offers an unprecedented
                                opportunity to accelerate innovation toward greater sustainability and mitigate the

                                organizations meet increasing compute power demands while simultaneously helping support
                                net zero goals.</li>
                            <li>AI-powered predictive analytics can surface patterns and trends that may elude
                                traditional analysis, which means ESG reporting can become more accurate over time. This
                                data can help accelerate enterprises in planning future IT investments in alignment with
                                their environmental responsibility commitments, as well as create new business value.
                            </li>
