                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Use Cases for IoT-Enabled Railways</h2>
                            <p>Railway operators around the globe are implementing IoT-enabled solutions to create
                                intelligent, connected railways today. From advanced analytics applications to digital
                                signage and predictive maintenance, IoT technologies are being used in innovative ways
                                in
                                both existing and newly constructed railways. Here are some of the most common IoT use
                                cases
                                today:</p>
                            <p><b>Predictive Maintenance</b></p>
                            <p><a href="">Predictive maintenance</a> is a cost-effective, important safety and
                                efficiency
                                tool for railway operators. Transitioning away from reactive maintenance to predictive
                                maintenance helps allow operators to intervene before downtime occurs and create a
                                foundation for continuous improvement. It automates real-time monitoring of equipment by
                                using smart sensors and machine vision cameras and controls to gather data from tracks,
                                locomotives, trains, and equipment. With edge computing, data is analyzed close to where
                                it
                                is collected in near-real time, and alerts can be triggered if issues are detected.
                                Machine
                                learning can be used at the edge or in the cloud to analyze collected data to better
                                understand past equipment failures and help predict the likelihood of future downtime
                                and
                                maintenance requirements. These models can be continuously trained to help improve the
                                accuracy of maintenance predictions. The use of predictive maintenance ultimately aims
                                at
                                empowering operators to:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Plan and schedule maintenance cycles.</li>
                                <li>Optimize servicing schedules.</li>
                                <li>Minimize breakdowns and failures.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>With more predictable servicing and maintenance schedules and fewer resulting breakdowns,
                                railway operators benefit from lower maintenance costs and extended life cycles of
                                tracks,
                                trains, and equipment. Passengers benefit from improved reliability of railway
                                operations
                                and a better overall experience.</p>
                            <p><b>Safety Sensors</b></p>
                            <p>Keeping passengers and railway staff safe is the top priority for operators. Implementing
                                safety sensors across all parts of a railway is one way operators can provide a safer
                                rail experience for everyone during their transportation journey.</p>
                            <p>Safety sensors can be added to critical components of the train, such as breaks and
                                wheels, to help alert operators of any issues. Computer vision solutions can help enable
                                automated and safe platform and train screen door systems or help detect when passengers
                                slip and fall.</p>
                            <p><b>Asset Tracking</b></p>
                            <p>Railways deal with an almost unmanageable number of assets on a daily basis, including
                                tracks, equipment, stations, and passenger assets, such as luggage. Knowing where all
                                assets are at all times is imperative to helping keep everyone safe and operations
                                efficient. Using computer vision to track assets in near-real time can help reduce dwell
                                time of stationary locomotives and increase operational efficiency.</p>
                            <p><b>Passenger Flow</b></p>
                            <p>One of the biggest challenges operators face is getting passengers from one place to
                                another. Congestion, overcrowding, and the potential for crime result in inefficient
                                operations, lost revenue, and, ultimately, passenger dissatisfaction. Using cameras in
                                the station and onboard the train and deep learning and AI through computer vision,
                                operators can measure and analyze passenger flow to help improve operations
                                decision-making and station planning.</p>

                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Enhancing the Passenger Experience</h2>
                            <p>With so many travel options available to consumers, railways must also focus on
                                delivering an enhanced, frictionless, and convenient experience that keeps passengers
                                coming back for future travel. Digital signage, connected kiosks, 5G, and other
                                IoT-enabled technologies can be leveraged to keep passengers well informed and
                                entertained before and during transit.</p>
                            <p><b>Digital Signage and Connected Kiosks</b></p>
                            <p><a href="">Digital signage</a> and <a href="">connected kiosks</a> are intelligent,
                                convenient, and responsive and transform the passenger travel experience. They can
                                display near-real-time information with train and departure track updates; deliver
                                personalized offers and digital advertising; offer boarding pass scanners for quick
                                access to any departure times, track finders, or walking speeds; or optimize people flow
                                and wayfinding. When equipped with smart sensors, cameras, and accelerators, kiosks gain
                                even more capabilities, including responding to touchless gestures or automatically
                                triggering safety or emergency alerts based on what’s happening in the railway station,
                                such as a fire. Oftentimes, kiosks and digital signage can pay for themselves when
                                operators allow advertisers and retailers to monetize visual communications, engage
                                passengers, and boost revenue.</p>
                            <p>To keep its riders abreast of arrival times and any schedule changes, the <a href="">San
                                    Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS)</a> teamed up with <a href="">Cisco and
                                    Davra Networks</a> to implement an Intel® architecture-based solution that uses edge
                                intelligence to process location data from on-train devices. Scheduling information on
                                digital signage in stations and on trains is then dynamically updated in near-real time
                                based on changing variables.</p>
                            <p><b>Connectivity</b></p>
                            <p>With <a href="">5G technology</a> now a reality across the globe, operators can offer a
                                better Wi-Fi experience for everyone. Railway stations outfitted with 5G infrastructure
                                can offer 5G Wi-Fi to passengers through public kiosks located throughout the station.
                                For passengers, that means faster download speeds, lower latency, and data sharing are
                                available. When operators want to offer more robust Wi-Fi onboard, wireless connectivity
                                servers can help provide passengers with the same level of speed and reliability they
                                get at home.</p>
                            <p>To provide passengers with uninterrupted onboard Wi-Fi infotainment, the <a
                                    href="">Glacier Express and Bernina Express</a> in Switzerland, run by the Rhaetian
                                Railway (RhB), turned to the Advantech Passengera platform. The platform is hosted on
                                railway-compliant Advantech onboard servers powered by Intel® technologies and includes
                                an advanced antenna system. Passengera allows passengers seeking a scenic ride to use
                                their smartphones and/or tablets to view specially produced video and audio content that
                                describes scenery and points of interest based on the train’s location. It also provides
                                railway operators with prime passenger demographic data for developing targeted
                                promotions and increasing viewership with high-quality content.</p>
                            <p><b>Smart Ticketing Automated Fare Collection</b></p>
                            <p>By implementing sensor beacons, edge computing, AI, and cloud-based technologies,
                                operators can eliminate queue lines at ticket machines. Using sensors on station
                                platforms or trains, the system is designed to detect a specific smartphone app as
                                passengers enter the station or train and automatically charge the correct fair. This
                                not only streamlines the process for both passengers and operators but can also simplify
                                back-end billing and revenue management and collect usage behavior for long-term
