                    <p>Building a trustworthy brand requires a thoughtful content strategy. Content production and media
                        alignment must be brand-safe and suitable for target audiences. Yet, the tremendous volume of
                        digital content and wide variety of channels makes it nearly impossible for companies to ensure
                        that what they distribute consistently upholds brand standards.</p>

                    <p>Seekr is helping solve this problem for the advertising industry with SeekrAlign*, a solution
                        that leverages proprietary scoring and analysis technology to help brands find the most suitable
                        online content and grow their reach responsibly. </p>

                        Seekr’s first-to-market AI solution quickly garnered an impressive cross-industry customer list
                        of leading brands. From Moderna and SimpliSafe to Babbel, companies are realizing the value of

                        <h3 style="font-weight: 300;">Challenges & Opportunities of AI </h3>
                        <p>Misinformation, hallucinations, and inappropriate content can quickly erode brand trust. Even
                            inadvertently associating with platforms that host at-risk content can endanger a brand’s
                            reputation. For this reason, many companies closely screen the content they distribute. This
                            practice is time-consuming, expensive, unreliable, and highly subjective.</p>
                        <p>A primary use case is podcasts. The popularity of podcasts has grown exponentially in recent
                            years, and for many companies, podcasts are an essential part of their content strategy and
                            advertising revenue. Unfortunately, the podcast landscape has been especially difficult for
                            brands to navigate as, until now, there has been no reliable way to evaluate singular
                            episodes other than human effort. </p>
                        <p>SeekrAlign solves this challenge by allowing companies to quickly and accurately screen
                            hundreds of thousands of podcasts. “Align simplifies finding safe and suitable podcasts by
                            marrying world-class engineering with innovative and transparent ratings, allowing brands to
                            navigate with nuance so they can confidently grow their audio campaign with increased
                            clarity and speed,” said Dan Granger, CEO of podcast advertising agency Oxford Road.
                            <sup>1</sup></p>
                        <p>Align’s user-friendly dashboard rates podcast content on a scale between 0-100. Based on the
                            GARM safety framework, this patented rating system, called the Seekr Civility Score™, gives
                            marketers and advertisers an objective standard to judge content safety and suitability.
                            “This challenge, at this vast scale, could only have been solved by combining superior
                            computing power with novel signal detection,” said Rob Clark, President and Chief Technology
                            Officer of Seekr. “The Civility Score synthesizes dozens of considerations into a single
                            metric that opens the door to more brand-suitable opportunities and larger audiences.
                            <sup>”2</sup></p>
                        <p>The Align platform has already scored 20 million minutes of podcasts, a number that is
                            projected to reach up to 40 million by the end of 2024. In addition, the platform has
                            real-time scores for more than 8,000 podcast episodes, totaling more than 10 million minutes
                            of audio. “We've shown that when AI is applied responsibly and transparently, it can solve
                            real business challenges as this technology continues to develop and advance," said Clark.
                            “I look forward to building on this success through continued innovation, including the
                            development of advanced LLMs that can help solve some of the most vexing social issues and
                            drive business growth with incredible speed and accuracy. <sup>”3</sup></p>

                        <h3 style="font-weight: 300;">Delivering High Performance with Reduced Cloud Compute Costs</h3>
                        <p>Seekr’s sophisticated AI workload requirements demand immense compute capacity. Historically,
                            this compute power would require a significant infrastructure investment and considerable
                            cloud costs. But with the Intel Developer Cloud, Seekr can access leading-edge Intel
                            hardware and software for a fraction of the price. For a quickly scaling company such as
                            Seekr, the ability to conserve capital and grow revenue while accessing the latest AI
                            acceleration technology is an incredibly attractive proposition.</p>
                        <p>“This strategic collaboration with Intel allows Seekr to build foundation models at the best
                            price and performance using a super-computer of 1,000s of the latest Intel Gaudi chip, all
                            backed by high bandwidth interconnectivity,” said Clark. Seekr’s trustworthy AI products
                            combined with the ‘AI-first’ Intel Developer Cloud reduces errors and bias, so organizations
                            of all sizes can access reliable LLMs and foundation models to unlock productivity and fuel
                            innovation, running on trusted hardware.”</p>

                            resources and dependencies are flexible, allowing for countless configuration options. </p>
                        <P>SeekrFlow’s workflow is compiled into a versioned, repeatable, and reproducible executable.
                            It also integrates robust alignment algorithms to ensure the LLM's behavior complies with
                            prescribed standards, intentions, rules, or values. These LLMs also benefit from the
                            company’s robust inference pipeline, enabling the platform to transcribe, diarize, and score
                            audio at scale. Once optimized, these custom LLMs are piped into the user-friendly Seekr
                            Align platform where they are used to provide fast and accurate evaluations of digital
                            content.</P>

                        <P>Seekr had been using a regional colocation provider to host a server fleet of GPU and
                            CPU-enabled systems. The self-managed compute infrastructure is used for LLM and multimodal
                            model development and supports Seekr Align. </P>
                        <P>With customer growth and the increasing size of LLM deployment, Seekr sought a cloud services
                            provider to help scale its businesses through superior price and performance. After
                            successfully fine-tuning and inferencing benchmarking LLMs on Intel Gaudi 2, Seekr decided
                            to leverage Intel Developer Cloud as its preferred computing infrastructure for LLM
                            development and production deployment support. </P>
                        <P><b>Figures 1-3</b> show the performance gained through software optimizations and by using
                            Intel Developer Cloud’s environment.</P>

                            transformers. We saw improved performance for model training and inference compared to other
                            chips in the market. Specifically on LLM inference, the large memory capacity of the Intel
                            HPUs and GPUs has allowed us to adjust workload-specific parameters, such as batch sizes. On
                            the software side, the various Intel extensions enabled us to move our ML stack to Intel
                            hardware seamlessly.” </p>
