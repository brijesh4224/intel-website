                                    infrastructure, middleware, operating system, and even the applications.</p>

                                service-oriented application development and microservice-based deployment.</h4>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4" id="key1">What Is FaaS?</h3>
                        <p class="my-0">Different types of cloud computing have gained popularity in recent years as IT
                            leaders embrace the convenience, scalability, and cost advantages of this flexible approach
                            to infrastructure management.</p>
                        <p>Cloud service providers (CSPs) have responded with a variety of different cloud service
                            models, each with its own level of service. One of the most comprehensive offerings is
                            Function as a Service (FaaS).</p>
                        <p>In the FaaS model, customers execute code in the cloud, while the CSP hosts and manages the
                            entire back-end operation, from infrastructure through applications. Customers are
                            responsible only for their own data and the functions they perform.</p>
                        <p>Typically, the FaaS customer pays only for the actual runtime required to execute the
                            âfunctionâ in Function as a Service. Execution may take a fraction of a second, and the FaaS
                            system can scale rapidly to accommodate multiple instances simultaneously. There is no
                            ongoing cost charged to the customer for the idle time between the execution of one function
                            and the next.</p>
                        <p>This event-driven pricing makes this cloud service model an economical choice for developers
                            who have intermittent or sporadic processing needs.</p>
                        <p>Common uses of FaaS include data processing, validation, and sorting, as well as back-end
                            support for mobile and IoT applications.</p>
                        <h3 class=" mt-5 pt-4">âServerless Computingâ That Runs on Servers</h3>
                        <p>The FaaS model is considered âserverlessâ from the clientâs perspective because the CSP
                            manages the cloud infrastructure, platform, operating system, and software applicationsâall
                            of which may be opaque to the user.</p>
                        <p>âServerless computingâ is something of a misnomer, however. Even though FaaS users do not
                            manage or even see the hardware, the FaaS model does run on servers. The hardware is owned,
                            operated, and managed by the CSP, so customers can take full advantage of the functionality
                            on demand, without purchasing or maintaining their own servers.</p>

                        <p>With most CSPsâ FaaS offerings, the platform components are not specified in any detail.
                            Users cannot typically request a specific hardware technology for their virtual machines.
                            Certain features of IntelÂ® hardware, such as <a
                                href="../rushita_Solutions/k_solutions_To_cloud_Advanced-Vector-Extensions.html"
                                class="s_link_dark1">IntelÂ®
                                AVX-512</a> and <a

                                class="s_link_dark1">AVX2</a> accelerators, help to optimize
                            performance and improve user satisfaction. For that reason, some CSPs prefer to run their
                            FaaS service offerings on IntelÂ® technology-based platforms.</p>
                        <p>Even though software developers cannot specify Intel technology-based virtual machines in a
                            FaaS environment, they can ask the CSP for access to Intel-optimized code libraries. Some of
                            these libraries are available in the suite of <a
                                href="../dhruvin_developer-tools/Development-Tools/ds_OneApi-Toolkit.html"
                                class="s_link_dark1">IntelÂ® oneAPI
                                toolkits</a> and include performance-enhancing code to accelerate complex math routines,
                            compression, encryption, and other compute-intensive tasks. Such optimizations can help the
                            user to save runtime and money on FaaS implementations.</p>
                        <h3>What Are Microservices?</h3>
                        <p>Microservices are part of an application architecture, where a section of the application
                            code operates somewhat independently from other functions. When developing a complex
                            application, the microservices approach isolates different functions from each other, so the
                            entire application can continue to operate even if one service fails.</p>
                        <p>A microservice-based software development environment can be achieved in the context of a
                            service-oriented architecture. Complex applications are built and maintained as a collection
                            of discrete services that are loosely integrated via application programming interfaces
                            (APIs.) Service-oriented software applications and their component microservices are easier
                            to maintain and upgrade because individual services can be patched or upgraded without
                            taking down the entire application.</p>
                        <p>Many microservice modules can be both developed and delivered efficiently in a FaaS
                            environment. In many cases, the microservices are containerized, or isolated further, to
                            improve control over each individual portion of the larger application.</p>

                    <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4" id="key2">How Does Function as a Service Work?</h3>
                    <p>From the userâs perspective, Function as a Service is a prebuilt environment for software
                        development or deployment. The CSP owns and manages the entire tech stack, including all
                        hardware, middleware, and software.</p>
                    <p>In other cloud services models, the user pays, over a defined period of time, for ongoing access
                        to certain virtual machines or containers and for the resources they consume. In the FaaS model,
                        customers pay only for the time and resources needed to produce a function.</p>
                    <p>In one CSPâs pricing structure, for example, the duration of a function and its resource
                        deployment are measured in âgigabyte seconds,â rounded up to the nearest millisecond.
                        <sup>2</sup>
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4" id="key3">Advantages of FaaS</h3>
                    <p>FaaS users benefit from a pay-as-you-go pricing model that distinguishes this type of cloud
                        computing from other âas a Serviceâ models. The CSP owns and manages the entire technology
                        stack, from hardware through the application software and tools, leaving the users to manage
                        only their own data and functions.</p>
                    <p>The users pay only for the time when functions or services are actively running in the FaaS
                        environment. These bursts of activity are often measured in milliseconds. The user does not pay
                        for the idle time between those bursts.</p>
                    <p>FaaS is best suited to workloads that are unpredictable and intermittent.</p>

                    <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4" id="key4">Challenges of FaaS</h3>
                    <p>For prolonged, uninterrupted workloads, a different âas a Serviceâ model could be more economical
                        than FaaS. Because FaaS usage is often measured and paid in millisecond increments, and FaaS is
                        much more expensive than a typical IaaS cloud service, the constant usage can become
                        prohibitively expensive.</p>
                    <p>FaaS implementations can also be difficult to debug because the makeup of the development
                        environment is opaque to the user. When extensive testing is required, a different cloud
                        computing model would be preferable, so the user can specify and control for a variety of
                        standard ecosystems. If the software technology is mature and fully platform independent,
                        however, FaaS can be a good fit.</p>

                    <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4" id="key5">FaaS Use Cases</h3>
                    <p><b>On-demand functionality</b> is an overall usage model that is well suited to a FaaS
                        environment. In an on-demand setting, features are powered up and down quickly and
                        intermittently. The FaaS user pays only for the time when the feature is active, so the
                        on-demand model is an economical use of FaaS.</p>
                    <p><b>Interactive websites</b> are an example of an on-demand usage model, specifically in back-end
                        execution. The FaaS is activated only when an end user clicks on the website and triggers a
                        brief event. Online media publishers and e-commerce sites take advantage of the FaaS model for
                        its flexibility, as users access their site on an unpredictable schedule. For example, a company
                        that provides streaming media may manage its primary site, with its user menus and
                        recommendations, on a CSPâs FaaS plan.</p>
                    <p><b>Data processing and validation</b> tasks may be adapted successfully to a FaaS model. One use
                        case would be an Internet of Things (IoT) installation that sends sensor data to the cloud
                        intermittently for analysis.</p>
                    <p><b>Software development</b> may also be deployed in a FaaS setting, provided that the development
                        workload is intermittent.</p>
                    <p><b>Software deployment</b> can be a good fit with the FaaS model for the delivery of
                        microservices. Software as a Service (SaaS) providers may also run their own operations on a
                        FaaS basis during the start-up phase when they are adding new users quickly and the software is
                        being used in an irregular, on-again-off-again pattern.</p>

                    <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4" id="key6">Types of Cloud Computing</h3>
                    <p>Cloud computing services can be divided into two basic categories: public and private. Many
                        organizations deploy a combination of the two cloud service models, in hybrid or multicloud
                        configurations.</p>

                    <h3>Public Cloud</h3>
                    <p>In a <a
                            href="../rushita_Solutions/k_solutions_Topics_Viewall_Cloud-Architecture-Security_Public-Cloud-Solutions.html"
                            class="s_link_dark1">public cloud</a> service model, the user pays for usage of
                        the CSPâs computing, storage, and network resources. Public cloud services are available on
                        demand, so they can be deployed quickly and budgeted as an operating expense with little
                        up-front investment.</p>
                    <h3>Private Cloud</h3>
                    <p>By contrast, a <a
                            href="../rushita_Solutions/k_solutions_Topics_Viewall_Cloud-Architecture-Security_Private-Cloud-Solutions.html"
                            class="s_link_dark1">private cloud</a> runs on the organizationâs own
                        data center, which requires a significant up-front investment in hardware as well as ongoing
                        management. Over the long term, a private cloud may be more economical than public cloud service
                        models in some cases.</p>
                    <p>The advantages of a private cloud include localized control over intellectual property and
                        regulatory compliance, as well as support for business-critical workloads and applications that
                        may not migrate easily to the public cloud.</p>

                    <h3>Hybrid Cloud</h3>
                    <p>With a <a
                            href="../rushita_Solutions/k_solutions_Topics_Viewall_Cloud-Architecture-Security_Hybrid-Cloud.html"
                            class="s_link_dark1">hybrid cloud</a>, organizations enjoy the benefits of
                        both the public and private cloud service models. The hybrid cloud connects the public and
                        private clouds so an organization can share applications and data between the two environments.
                        Hybrid clouds offer flexibility, scalability, control, and potential cost savings.</p>
                    <h3>Multicloud</h3>
                    <p>In a <a href="../M_Solutions/s_What_is_Multicloud.html" class="s_link_dark1">multicloud</a>
                        model, the organization takes advantage of
                        cloud computing services from several different CSPs. Resource deployment is typically managed
                        in software. A multicloud strategy is extremely flexible because the organization can balance
                        its workloads and optimize costs without being locked into a single CSPâs service offering or
                        technology stack.</p>
                    <p>Many organizations specify IntelÂ® technology-based instances at each CSP in the multicloud
                        deployment to enable consistency and compatibility across providers.</p>

                    <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4" id="key7">IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS</h3>
                    <p>Many CSPs offer a spectrum of <a
                            href="../rushita_Solutions/k_solutions_To_cloud_Service-Models.html"
                            class="s_link_dark1">cloud computing âas a
                            Serviceâ</a>&nbsp;choices, from mere access to server hardware up to and including
                        full-scale, comprehensive options like FaaS.</p>
                    <h3>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h3>
                    <p>The most familiar, basic cloud computing service is known as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS.)
                        In the IaaS model, the CSP owns and manages all hardware, including servers, networking, and
                        storage. The user is responsible for the software stack, including subscriptions, licenses,
                        upgrades, and maintenance for all operating systems and applications as well as the
                        organizationâs data and functions.</p>
                    <p>IT managers gravitate to IaaS as an alternative to purchasing and maintaining on-premises or
                        colocated hardware, with the associated capital expense. IaaS is a flexible model that can scale
                        with the userâs needs, and the CSPâs fees are treated as an operational expense in the
                        organizationâs budget.</p>

                    <h3>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h3>
                    <p>Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud services model that offers a more complete development
                        and deployment environment. A CSPâs PaaS offerings typically include all the hardware
                        infrastructure of IaaS plus building blocks that comprise the software platform: the operating
                        system, middleware, development tools, and some types of data management and analytics services.
                    </p>
                    <p>PaaS users continue to manage the application layer of the software stack, as well as their own
                        data and functions, just as they would in an IaaS arrangement.</p>
                    <h3>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h3>
                    <p>SaaS, or Software as a Service, is likely the most widespread of the cloud computing service
                        models. There are examples of SaaS deployment at almost every organization, including those who
                        reject IaaS in favor of owning and managing a robust, on-premises server infrastructure.</p>
                    <p>Some applications, such as email, CRM, productivity suites, and file storage, are delivered
                        conveniently in a SaaS model. The organization pays licensing fees for a given time period, and
                        the applications are made available in the cloud. Users and IT teams avoid time-consuming
                        downloads and installations, and there is no need for them to manage updates.</p>
