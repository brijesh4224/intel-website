                            <p>SANTA CLARA, Calif., Dec. 2, 2024 – Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) today announced that
                                CEO Pat Gelsinger retired from the company after a distinguished 40-plus-year career and
                                has stepped down from the board of directors, effective Dec. 1, 2024. </p>
                            <p>Intel has named two senior leaders, <a href="">David Zinsner</a> and <a href="">Michelle
                                    (MJ) Johnston Holthaus</a>, as
                                interim co-chief executive officers while the board of directors conducts a search for a
                                new CEO. Zinsner is executive vice president and chief financial officer, and Holthaus
                                has been appointed to the newly created position of CEO of Intel Products, a group that
                                encompasses the company’s Client Computing Group (CCG), Data Center and AI Group (DCAI)
                                and Network and Edge Group (NEX). <a href="">Frank Yeary</a>, independent chair of the
                                board of Intel,
                                will become interim executive chair during the period of transition. Intel Foundry
                                leadership structure remains unchanged.</p>
                            <p>The board has formed a search committee and will work diligently and expeditiously to
                                find a permanent successor to Gelsinger.</p>
                            <p>Yeary said, “On behalf of the board, I want to thank Pat for his many years of service
                                and dedication to Intel across a long career in technology leadership. Pat spent his
                                formative years at Intel, then returned at a critical time for the company in 2021. As a
                                leader, Pat helped launch and revitalize process manufacturing by investing in
                                state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing, while working tirelessly to drive
                                innovation throughout the company.”</p>
                            <p>Yeary continued, “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing
                                competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that
                                we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor
                                confidence. As a board, we know first and foremost that we must put our product group at
                                the center of all we do. Our customers demand this from us, and we will deliver for
                                them. With MJ’s permanent elevation to CEO of Intel Products along with her interim
                                co-CEO role of Intel, we are ensuring the product group will have the resources needed
                                to deliver for our customers. Ultimately, returning to process leadership is central to
                                product leadership, and we will remain focused on that mission while driving greater
                                efficiency and improved profitability.” </p>
                            <p>Yeary concluded, “With Dave and MJ’s leadership, we will continue to act with urgency on
                                our priorities: simplifying and strengthening our product portfolio and advancing our
                                manufacturing and foundry capabilities while optimizing our operating expenses and
                                capital. We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel.”</p>
                            <p>Gelsinger said, “Leading Intel has been the honor of my lifetime – this group of people
                                is among the best and the brightest in the business, and I’m honored to call each and
                                every one a colleague. Today is, of course, bittersweet as this company has been my life
                                for the bulk of my working career. I can look back with pride at all that we have
                                accomplished together. It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made
                                tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics. I am
                                forever grateful for the many colleagues around the world who I have worked with as part
                                of the Intel family.”</p>
                            <p>Throughout Gelsinger’s tenure at Intel across a variety of roles, he has driven
                                significant innovation and advanced not only the business but the broader global
                                technology industry. A highly respected leader and skilled technologist, he has played
                                an instrumental role in focusing on innovation while also creating a sense of urgency
                                throughout the organization. Gelsinger began his career in 1979 at Intel, growing at the
                                company to eventually become its first chief technology officer.</p>
                            <p>Zinsner and Holthaus said, “We are grateful for Pat’s commitment to Intel over these many
                                years as well as his leadership. We will redouble our commitment to Intel Products and
                                meeting customer needs. With our product and process leadership progressing, we will be
                                focused on driving returns on foundry investments.” </p>
                            <p>Zinsner has more than 25 years of financial and operational experience in semiconductors,
                                manufacturing and the technology industry. He joined Intel in January 2022 from Micron
                                Technology Inc., where he was executive vice president and CFO. Zinsner served in a
                                variety of other leadership roles earlier in his career, including president and chief
                                operating officer at Affirmed Networks and senior vice president of finance and CFO at
                                Analog Devices.</p>
                            <p>Holthaus is a proven general manager and leader who began her career with Intel nearly
                                three decades ago. Prior to being named CEO of Intel Products, she was executive vice
                                president and general manager of CCG. Holthaus has held a variety of management and
                                leadership roles at Intel, including chief revenue officer and general manager of the
                                Sales and Marketing Group, and lead of global CCG sales.</p>
