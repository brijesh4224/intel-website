                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">The Innovative XR Industry</h2>
                        <p>As a core application of the metaverse, XR can create immersive virtual worlds through
                            technologies such as VR/AR graphic generation and display, multi-sensing and mapping,
                            dynamic environment modeling, real-time motion capture, and rapid rendering, and has the
                            ability to interact with the physical world to a certain extent. XR provides users with new
                            entertainment experience and is expected to completely reshape man-machine interaction in
                            the future. XR also has applications in sectors such as industry, healthcare, and retail,
                            where they play a key role in training, remote surgery, and remote supervision.</p>
                        <p>The rapid commercialization of 5G networks has facilitated the development of high-bandwidth,
                            low-latency connections, which in turn has driven the development of the XR industry and the
                            growth of the XR market. Strategy Analytics projects strong growth in the XR market over the
                            next few years. Sales are projected to grow sixfold from 2020 to 2025, with revenue expected
                            to reach USD 27 billion.</p>
                        <p>XR is not an isolated application; its development depends on breakthroughs in such areas as
                            cloud computing power, terminals, and networks.</p>
                        <p>At the computing level, the need for XR applications to deliver sufficiently immersive
                            virtual experience means high demands for screen resolution, latency, and variety of
                            interactive experience. As this involves a huge amount of calculations and data
                            transmissions, the requirements for basic resources are very high, and it is difficult for
                            terminal computing power to meet this demand. Therefore, the base layer demand of XR in the
                            future will be for huge cloud data centers capable of converging basic compute, network, and
                            storage resources and connecting them to upper-layer applications through computing as a
                            service, storage as a service, and network as a service.</p>
                        <p>At the terminal display layer, a large number of XR applications are affected by bottlenecks
                            such as insufficient display resolution, narrow field of view, and high latency, resulting
                            in defects such as dizziness and insufficient immersion. Future XR applications will realize
                            16K resolution and a refresh rate of over 120Hz, ensuring a sufficiently smooth visual
                            experience. At the same time, XR devices must make use of technologies such as spatial
                            scanning and modeling, visual capture and rendering, tactile rendering, motion tracking, and
                            multi-sensor rendering to realize the interaction between the virtual world and physical
                            sensory experience, thereby delivering more diverse and immersive XR experience.</p>
                        <p>At the network layer, high-speed and low-latency network transmission technologies such as
                            5G, 6G, and eventually 7G will facilitate the integration of base platforms and terminal
                            equipment.</p>
                        <p></p>
