                            bound by the applicable supplementary terms and conditions. These Terms will apply and

                            Terms”). Modified Terms will be effective when posted by Intel, and your use of the Websites
                            or the Materials after the posting of the Modified Terms will be deemed your acceptance of
                            and agreement to be bound by the Modified Terms. The date on which the Modified Terms are
                            posted will be stated at the beginning of the Modified Terms. If you do not agree to the
                            Modified Terms, you must stop using the Websites and Materials. Notwithstanding the
                            foregoing, Modified Terms will not impact the terms of any Agreement executed through an
                            electronic signature tool on the Websites without prior written consent of the parties

                            convenience only and that the English-language versions of these Terms will govern your
                            relationship with Intel. If there is any contradiction between the English-language version
                            of these Terms and the translation, the English-language version will govern and control.
