                    <h2>Accelerate Data Center Sustainability with a Holistic Approach</h2>
                    <p>Data centers need to store and process massive amounts of data. As more businesses support emerging workloads such as artificial intelligence (AI), 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), and high performance computing (HPC), they’re generating exponentially more data. As data generation soars, so do the cost and power needed to run data centers and servers.</p>
                    <p>At Intel, we’re helping organizations like yours meet business demands for increased storage and faster networking and HPC while optimizing the data center for greater energy efficiency and less hardware waste. Intel’s end-to-end approach to data center sustainability—across hardware, software, services, and tools—can help you improve efficiency, save energy, and lower your total cost of ownership (TCO) by up to 75 percent,1 all while reducing your carbon footprint and supporting your environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategy.</p>
