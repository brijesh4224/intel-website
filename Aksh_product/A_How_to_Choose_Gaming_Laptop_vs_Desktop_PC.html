                                            PC, performance probably shouldn’t be a huge factor in your decision. While
                                            laptop systems once had the reputation of being underpowered compared to
                                            their desktop counterparts, that is no longer always the case.

                                        <p class="V_pv pt-1">Modern gaming laptops can be incredibly efficient and
                                            powerful. Though desktops can still have a performance edge when it comes to
                                            high-end components and thermal considerations, the difference is much less
                                            pronounced than it used to be.

                                            question to ask yourself is whether you prefer a computer you can use
                                            anywhere, or one that is larger and heavier but provides more ports and
                                            customization options.

                                        <strong class="V_pv ">Laptop</strong>
                                        <p class="V_pv ">The primary strength of a laptop is portability. With the right
                                            laptop, you’ll have the ability to do most of what you can do with a
                                            desktop, just about anywhere.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">If you’re someone who is often away from home, this flexibility
                                            can be hugely beneficial. Recent laptops are more compact than ever, so you
                                            can use them in places you wouldn't (or shouldn’t) normally bring a desktop,
                                            like on an airplane, or your favorite coffee shop.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Gaming laptops, meanwhile, often have high-end hardware that
                                            allows for competitive and AAA gaming wherever you are.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Laptops run on a battery and have a built-in display, along with
                                            an onboard keyboard and trackpad, but you can also have a desktop-like
                                            experience at home with the right peripherals. Additional equipment like
                                            docking stations, mice, keyboards, and external gaming displays can further
                                            increase the versatility of a laptop, though it does add cost beyond the
                                            initial purchase.
                                        </p>

                                        <p class="V_pv">Desktops, on the other hand, are much larger, and not nearly as
                                            portable. Even the <a href="#" class="V_andecor_r">smallest form factor
                                                desktop</a> will still require a power outlet and a monitor. Although

                                            compact form factor makes it difficult to upgrade. On many laptops the
                                            processor and graphics card are soldered onto the motherboard, or are
                                            prohibitively difficult to access. Desktops have the upper hand in this
                                            regard, with easily accessible internal components.

                                        <p class="V_pv ">Because of the compact design of laptops, they are
                                            substantially more difficult to upgrade. Some laptops might allow you to
                                            upgrade your RAM or storage, but upgrading the CPU or GPU is almost never a
                                            practical option for the average user. When you purchase a laptop, consider
                                            that you'll be using more or less the same internal components for as long
                                            as you have the machine.

                                            Because of the modular layout, components can be replaced with relative
                                            ease, which allows you to upgrade your hardware as necessary. Instead of
                                            buying a new machine when your PC starts to show its age, you’re able to
                                            incrementally update as necessary, keeping your desktop up-to-date with the
                                            latest hardware.
