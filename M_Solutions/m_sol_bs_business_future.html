                            Businesses are just starting to truly realize the value of AI and automation, whether it’s
                            in their supply chain, product development process, or operations. Artificial intelligence
                            can help businesses predict—and improve—outcomes by finding patterns in massive volumes of
                            previously untapped data, both structured and unstructured. These insights help
                            decision-makers identify new markets and products, optimize pricing, improve forecasting
                            accuracy, and much more.

                            businesses are also using AI at the edge—in their field equipment, on manufacturing lines,
                            in their infrastructure—to enable automation and other real-time processes. For example, <a

                            defects in a production line, streamlining quality assurance. Autonomous <a href=""
                                class="m_color m_underline">virus-killing robots</a> are being used to disinfect
                            surfaces in hospitals, helping patients and healthcare workers avoid dangerous pathogens.

                            can be used to treat COVID-19. Intel’s team of volunteers developed a system to help predict

                            ventilation assistance. In June 2020, Intel’s team was named first-place winner. Sheba
                            announced that Intel’s solution will be implemented both at the Sheba Medical Center and

                            high-performance, low-power processors, analytics and AI are coming out of the cloud and
                            directly to these endpoints. With the addition of edge computing, IoT has become truly

                            For example, smart cameras equipped with vision processing units (VPUs) can analyze video
                            feeds in real time to “see” what’s happening at a busy event venue, on a factory floor, or
                            at a traffic intersection. An edge server in a retail store can perform advanced analytics
                            on customer data while keeping it on location, complying with data locality requirements.
                            Edge computing is a fantastic complement to cloud computing for data that is best stored

                            throughout the building to help with wayfinding, dining options, and more. When choosing
                            technologies, we selected several Intel® IoT Market Ready Solutions (Intel® IMRS) designed
                            for smart buildings and visual communications. With this model, we realized a lower CapEx

                                There’s a major transition happening in the world of <a href=""
                                    class="m_color m_underline">advanced analytics</a>. It used to be that analytics
                                simply looked at historical data for a better understanding of what’s already happened.
                                Today, some of the most exciting possibilities in interpreting data involve predictive
                                analytics—in other words, solving problems before they happen. Advanced analytics is
                                also helping businesses tap into data sources that were previously inaccessible, such as
                                images, audio, video, and IoT sensor data.

                                Predictive analytics allows businesses to understand prospective outcomes and optimize
                                those outcomes for change. For example, telematics data fed into predictive analytics
                                software can notify a fleet manager when preventive maintenance is needed on a vehicle.
                                Augmenting analytics with AI offers even more: retailers can get a better idea of where
                                customers move throughout a store; manufacturers can identify malfunctioning or
                                defective products; and healthcare systems can better evaluate which patient populations
                                need follow-up care.

                            Today’s IT teams are facing a sophisticated generation of cybercriminals. Hackers are attacking more layers of the hardware-software stack, and with new connected devices being added to corporate networks, there are a growing number of potential entry points to target.

                            One of the most important <a href="" class="m_color m_underline">information security and risk management</a> strategies is to emphasize protection at every point in the network. Intel IT has taken their information security (InfoSec) practices to a new level with a <a href="" class="m_color m_underline">Cyber Intelligence Platform (CIP)</a>. CIP ingests data from hundreds of sources and security tools. With access to real-time data, streams processing, machine-learning tools, consistent data models, and orchestration and automation capabilities, Intel IT can detect and respond to incidents within hours or minutes, instead of days or weeks. CIP infrastructure is based on Intel® Xeon® Platinum processors.

                            It’s also important to employ both hardware- and software-based security technologies. For example, for business PCs, the <a href="" class="m_color m_underline">Intel vPro® platform</a> provides enhanced protections against attacks below the operating system (OS) and advanced threat detection capabilities with Intel® Hardware Shield.

                            Business runs on PCs, and to keep productivity high, IT administrators must troubleshoot any issues as quickly as possible. However, a large portion of the workforce is now working remotely, out of reach of the help desk.

To deliver the IT support users need, administrators should be able to remotely diagnose, configure, and update PCs, as well as install new software and patches. Designed for business PCs, the <a href="" class="m_color m_underline">Intel vPro® platform</a> includes <a href="" class="m_color m_underline">Intel® Active Management Technology</a> to let IT administrators remotely manage and repair PCs, even if they are powered off or <a href="" class="m_color m_underline">out of band</a>. Not only does this improve IT system management and help reduce IT support costs, but it also can minimize downtime for users.
