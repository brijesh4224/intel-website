                        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) enhances the performance and functionality of almost every
                            appliance, device, and vehicle made today. Students must learn to understand and manage AI
                            and related technologies to be successful now and in the future.</p>
                        <p>Students will need to acquire digital skills, knowledge, and understanding to enable them to
                            use technology responsibly and effectively. The term “digital readiness” describes the
                            combined skill sets, toolsets, and mindsets that will prepare students for the future.</p>
                        <p>When today’s K‒12 students join the workforce, now and in the coming years, demand will
                            continue to increase for employees with skills in AI, machine learning, data analytics, and
                            other computer science specialties. The World Economic Forum<sup>1</sup> anticipates that AI
                            alone could create 97 million new jobs by 2025.
                        <p>Students will need to acquire digital skills, knowledge, and understanding to enable them to
                            use technology responsibly and effectively. The term “digital readiness” describes the
                            combined skill sets, toolsets, and mindsets that will prepare students for the future.</p>
                        </p>
                        <p>To support students’ digital readiness and future success, educators should introduce AI
                            concepts, demonstrate AI use cases, and help students to understand issues surrounding
                            ethics in AI. This learning can begin in the early primary grades to lay the groundwork for
                            building advanced skills in the middle school and high school years.</p>
                        <h3>Introducing AI Concepts</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_bluehover1">To prepare students adequately for an evolving job market, primary school educators and
                            schools can support increased student engagement with <a
                                href="#">AI in
                                education</a>.</p>
                        <p>By adapting lessons to the students’ current capabilities and incorporating hands-on learning
                            experiences, educators can demystify this highly sophisticated, advanced technology and
                            prepare students for a data-driven future. AI skills and understanding can be integrated
                            into an engaging and actionable curriculum, even for the youngest students.</p>
                        <p>Many—or possibly most—students will never pursue further education or careers in computer
                            science. Understanding AI will nevertheless be instrumental in their future success.</p>
                        <p>According to a report by the World Economic Forum:<sup>2</sup></p>
                        <p>The top skills and skill groups which employers see as rising in prominence in the lead up to
                            2025 include critical thinking and analysis as well as problem-solving, and skills in
                            self-management such as active learning, resilience, stress tolerance and flexibility.</p>
                        <p>AI education can promote critical thinking and spur emotional intelligence as students
                            explore AI applications and analyze societal implications and ethics in AI, even for
                            students who never write a single line of code.</p>
                        <h3 class="mt-5">Recognizing AI</h3>
                        <p>According to AI4K12,<sup>3</sup> an initiative sponsored by computer science educators and AI
                            practitioners, there are five big ideas that all students should understand about
                            AI:<sup>4</sup></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Perception: Computers use sensors to perceive the world.</li>
                            <li>Representation and reasoning: Agents (algorithms, for example) maintain representations
                                of the world and use them for reasoning.</li>
                            <li>Learning: Computers can learn from data.</li>
                            <li>Natural interaction: Intelligent agents require many types of knowledge to interact
                                naturally with humans.</li>
                            <li>Societal impact: AI applications can impact society in both positive and negative ways.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>All five of these concepts can be conveyed in a developmentally appropriate way at any grade
                            level. The AI4K12 initiative is working to establish national guidelines and share resources

                        <p>In middle school and high school, students can begin to engage in hands-on learning.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_bluehover1">Lesson plans, activity guides, professional development programs, and other resources are
                            available to educators from <a href="">Intel®
                                Skills for Innovation</a>. In addition, sample projects and lessons can be found on the
                            <a
                                href="#">Intel®
                                Future Skills</a> site.</p>
                        <p>These resources and guidelines help educators and students to integrate AI and data science
                            into computer science courses and clubs, from the most basic introductory level to college
                            prep and advanced placement.</p>
                        <h3 class="mt-5">Ethics in AI</h3>
                        <p>AI-enabled programs and tools can be extremely beneficial, but the technology can also cause
                            harm. Ethical issues arise when AI algorithms or underlying data are deployed in a manner
                            that introduces bias, violates individual privacy, or compromises other human
                            rights.<sup>5</sup></p>
                        <p>A discussion or workshop on ethics in AI could be a valuable addition to the curriculum of
                            any school. This area of inquiry is as equally well suited to a philosophy or social studies
                            class as it is to a computer science lab.</p>
                        <p>When computer science students grapple with ethics in AI, however, they can express their
                            ideas in code as well as in class discussions and essays.</p>
                        <p>Another approach would be to have students develop their own ethical guidelines and
                            implementation strategies, as an individual or in a group project.</p>
                        <h3 class="mt-5">Intel® AI for Youth</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_bluehover1">Hands-on experimentation in building AI models might be most appropriate for high school
                            students. The <a
                                href="#">Intel®
                                AI for Youth</a> program, a flagship program of Intel® Digital Readiness efforts, is an
                            example of a successful, hands-on program that empowers young people with AI technical and
                            social skills in an inclusive way.</p>
                        <p>The school-age participants deploy AI concepts—including data, natural language processing,
                            and computer vision—to create their own AI projects, often with meaningful social impact.
                        </p>
                        <p>The program, now available in many countries, includes other topics related to AI ethics,
                            privacy, and potential biases, to hone problem-solving skills and spur creative thinking.

                        <h3>Choosing the Right Device for AI in Education</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_bluehover1">The <a href="#">right
                                devices</a> support students’ digital readiness, preparing them for higher education and
                            future careers. Even if the students never pursue degrees in computer science, they will be
                            better prepared to join an evolving workforce if they are adept at recognizing AI’s place in
                            everyday life.</p>
                        <p>When teaching AI, it’s important to equip students with devices that can handle a substantial
                            workload with minimal lag time. Students will be evaluating AI use cases and building AI
                            models, analyzing large files of audio and video data, and engaging in other tasks that
                            require processing power.</p>
                        <p>Manageability is also an important factor in determining which devices can be adapted to AI
                            in the classroom.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_bluehover1">For example, the&nbsp;<a
                                href="#">Intel® Core™
                                Ultra processors with Intel vPro® Enterprise for Windows OS</a> enables IT professionals
                            to fix devices in students’ homes remotely. This allows district IT staff to boost their
                            productivity and spend less time in transit.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_bluehover1">Out-of-band management tools are another key manageability feature. With tools such as <a
                                href="#">Intel®
                                Active Management Technology</a>, IT staff can access devices and fix problems even when
                            they’re experiencing OS problems or hardware issues.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_bluehover1">To help students stay safe in the digital world, Intel offers an <a
