                                        quality gaming desk setup can be.</p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">There are a lot of elements to consider when designing your desk
                                        layout, chief among them comfort and functionality. But there are also
                                        considerations — like your audio setup, display placement, how you position your
                                        mouse and keyboard, and countless other small features — that can have a huge
                                        impact on how you interact with your PC.</p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">We’ll be paying particular attention to ergonomics, or the science
                                        of increasing human accessibility, as well as aesthetics, or the way your setup
                                        looks. In this context, ergonomics applies to how our bodies interact with our
                                        technology, and how health and comfort are important considerations when putting
                                        together your ideal gaming station. While everyone has different tastes, and
                                        there’s no one ”right” way to put together your gaming station, we’re going to
                                        cover some of the most important options to consider when designing your ideal

                                    <h2 class="fw-lighter V_header_text">Your Desk</h2>

                                    <p class="V_pv">Your gaming desk is arguably the center of your setup; it’s what
                                        everything else is built around. When looking for the ideal PC gaming desk,
                                        there are a few key areas you’ll want to think about: comfort (ergonomics),
                                        surface area, construction material, and aesthetics. Whether your desk consists
                                        of two sawhorses and a countertop from a certain Swedish furniture manufacturer
                                        or a metal and glass table that belongs in a modern art museum, you’ll want
                                        something that walks the line of form and function.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="V_pv ">Start by deciding on your ideal desk surface. Glass, for example,
                                        might look nice, but it can make it difficult for a mouse to track, and a desk
                                        that can shatter is probably not ideal. Think about the weight you’ll be placing
                                        on the surface — such as multiple monitor arms or heavy displays — and make sure
                                        that surface is sufficiently sturdy. Also think about how you want it to look;
                                        polished wood is going to make a very different impression than marble.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">Considering the space you’re working in is also important. If you
                                        have a smaller space to work with, you might want a more minimalist setup,
                                        perhaps paired with a <a href="#" class="V_andecor_r">small form factor PC</a>.
                                        If you’re working with more room, an L-shaped desk that gives you plenty of
                                        space to spread out might be better. It’s also good to think about how often you
                                        move. Two sawhorses and an old door are much simpler to relocate than a giant PC
                                        case that also functions as a desk.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">Comfort and health should be a priority. That’s why standing desks
                                        are an increasingly popular option that allow you to work or play standing up or
                                        sitting down. Sitting all day can be <a href="#" class="V_andecor_r">hard on
                                            your body</a>, so having the flexibility to stand whenever you want can be
                                        helpful. Standing desks range from motorized, full-sized desks to smaller
                                        options that sit on your current desktop and can be lifted to an elevated
                                        position whenever you feel like stretching your legs. According to <a href="#"
                                            class="V_andecor_r">Dr. Drew Schwartz</a>, a full-time chiropractor and
                                        part-time gamer, “Standing desks aren’t the cure for sitting, but periodically
                                        varying your posture and position help significantly.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">Another feature of your setup you’ll want to consider is cable
                                        management. Properly routing all the cables in your setup can greatly improve
                                        aesthetics, simplify cleaning, and mitigate tripping hazards. There is a huge
                                        selection of cable routing and management options out there, such as sleeves,
                                        velcro cable ties, and cable boxes.

                                            pretty important, so you’ll want to think not only <a href="#"
                                                class="V_andecor_r">about finding the right display</a>, but also how to
                                            best position it. As streamer <a href="#" class="V_andecor_r">Freya Fox</a>
                                            told us, “Monitor placement will determine the feel of your setup. The trick
                                            is balancing ergonomics with aesthetics.”
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Before you can decide where to put your monitor(s), however, you
                                            need to decide how many you want. Multi-monitor setups continue to increase
                                            in popularity as people discover the benefits of increased screen real
                                            estate for working and gaming, but newer ultrawide monitors are also an
                                            excellent option.</p>

                                        <p class="V_pv">Once you have your monitors, it’s time to think about how best
                                            to position them. Two identical monitors side by side is a tried-and-true
                                            classic, but there are other options. Consider a television mounted to the
                                            wall above with a gaming monitor directly in front of you, or a display with
                                            another vertically oriented beside it.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">If you want to move and adjust your display whenever you like,
                                            you’ll want to find a mounting mechanism that allows for that flexibility.
                                            Assuming your monitor is VESA compatible — which most modern displays are —
                                            you have a huge selection of options beyond the stand that came with your
                                            display. There are monitor arms that attach to your desk in different ways,
                                            or wall mounts if you want the arm off of your desk entirely. These arms can
                                            allow you to reposition your display in whatever way feels right in the
                                            moment, while also freeing up precious desk space. If you do decide to go
                                            the arm or wall mount route, be sure to double-check that the solution
                                            you’re considering can handle the weight of your display.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Placement is about more than just convenience — it can also
                                            impact your health. “Your primary monitor should always be directly in front
                                            of you, which will limit muscle strain in the neck from constant rotation to
                                            one side,” says Dr. Schwartz. “If you’re using a dual monitor system, I
                                            recommend having the secondary display immediately adjacent to the primary,
                                            with the option to go vertical. The monitor should be approximately an arm’s
                                            length away, and the height should allow the eyes to be parallel with the
                                            upper third of the screen.”</p>

                                            So-called “gaming" chairs have surged in popularity over the last decade.
                                            Opinions about the aesthetics of these racing-style seats may vary, but
                                            there’s no question that the design has achieved widespread popularity. If
                                            you don’t care for the gaming aesthetic, well-designed office chairs will
                                            never go out of style, and there’s an even wider pool of options in terms of
                                            style, comfort levels, and price.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">There are several factors to keep in mind when picking the right
                                            chair beyond just looks. “Adjustability is the key when you’re sitting for
                                            prolonged periods of time, and firm support is a must,” says Dr. Schwartz.
                                            “Armrest adjustability in XYZ planes is a wonderful addition in order to
                                            properly support your forearms, and adjustable or removable lumbar support
                                            is a winner.”
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Regardless of your stylistic preference, you’ll want to consider
                                            your height and weight when choosing the right chair. A chair designed for a
                                            larger person might not be as comfortable to someone smaller, and vice

                                        <p class="V_pv">But it also depends on what you’re playing and your personal
                                            preferences.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">“It depends on the game, but for 99% of the time I have my

                                            “Sometimes, if I'm playing an FPS like <i>Overwatch</i> , I will tilt my

                                            aiming”.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Whatever feels right is probably the route you want to go, but
                                            you want to make sure your desk can support those preferences.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Your hand and wrist health factors in as well, as some people

                                            there are cloth pads with custom prints that cover your entire desk, or hard
                                            surface pads with RGB integration and USB passthrough for more convenient
                                            access. A mouse pad may not be mission critical, but it’s another way to add
                                            some luxury and flair to your desk setup. If you’re looking for a high level
                                            of performance from your mouse, it’s worth considering the surface you’re

                                            of network connectivity. None of this is difficult to install, and can make
                                            a huge difference in your space.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Not everyone needs a lighting setup this complex, but when
                                            you’re streaming, sometimes high levels of customization are important.
                                            According to Fox, “I use a variety of lights from LIFX smart bulbs to
                                            standard LED video lights with gels on them. I also have a few ‘uplights’
                                            which are just LED par lights that you'll find in any stage or theater
                                            production.”</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Smart lighting solutions like those from Philips Hue and
                                            Nanoleaf can create unique light profiles that react to the game you’re
                                            playing, making your entire room an extension of what you’re seeing on your
                                            screen.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Between these smart lighting solutions, ambient light strips,
                                            and RGB integration on PC components and peripherals, it’s easier than ever
                                            to turn your room into one giant light show.</p>

                                            gaming headsets across a spectrum of different features and price points.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">If you’re more of an audiophile, remember that even the most
                                            high-end headphones can be used with a computer. External headphone amps and
                                            DACs (Digital-to-Analog Converters) can go a long way toward simulating a
                                            high-end audio experience worthy of an expensive set of headphones. Even an
                                            entry-level USB DAC can make a big difference.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Though most gaming headsets have mics that are fine for
                                            communicating over Discord, you may want to invest in a standalone
                                            microphone and possibly an arm or mount. This is especially true if you’re
                                            recording voice for production or streaming. As with headsets, you can get a
                                            microphone specifically targeted to whatever you’re looking to record, and
                                            with the connectivity options you need to integrate it into your setup.</p>

                                            look a bit different from the average gamer. The perfect streaming setup is
                                            an entire subject of its own, but here are a few elements you’ll want to
                                            consider when building out your streaming rig.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">You’ll need to consider camera placement, and how you want to
                                            handle lighting. “I use a 3600 lumen ring light,” says Fox. “It's insanely
                                            bright and can be adjusted manually depending on how much light is needed.
                                            That sits directly in front of me with my camera mounted inside the ring.”
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">If you’re using a green screen, that’s an entirely separate
                                            setup process, and one with its own lighting needs. You’ll want to choose
                                            the right microphone and mic arm/stand, as well as condensers, mixers, and
                                            other sound equipment you can use to mix the perfect levels for your stream.
