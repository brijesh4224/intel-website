                        <p><a href="">Southern California Edison</a>, the primary electric utility company for much of
                            Southern California, exemplifies the challenges utilities face, including rising demand for
                            electric power, changing dynamics of distribution systems, and a fundamental change in
                            nature of how energy is provided due to integration with distributed energy resources (DER).
                            To address these industry issues, Intel helped form the <a href="">Virtualization of
                                Protection Automation and Control (vPAC) Alliance</a>, a strategic partnership of
                            industry leaders, to work together to future proof the energy grid by standardizing hardware
                            and virtualizing substation automation and control operations. </p>
                        <h2 class="d_head">The Problem</h2>
                        <p>Like many energy providers across the United States, Southern California Edison, which
                            provides electricity for 15 million people in Central and Southern California, is faced with
                            a profound change in customer electrical demands driven by decarbonization, building
                            electrification, and adoption of electric vehicles, all of which will increasingly stress
                            today’s power grid. The modern grid architecture was not designed to handle the future
                            demands of a changing energy landscape, as the need for electricity has grown and evolved.

                                            have in substations to software defined applications. So instead of physical

                        <p>Electric power grids were originally designed as one-way highways for electrons from
                            centralized generating stations to homes and businesses. The global shift towards DER has
                            led to a bi-directional flow in which solar and other weather-dependent sources can feed
                            surplus energy back into the grid. Additionally, the variability of these resources changes
                            the strength and stability of the system based on time of day, day of the year, and weather
                            condition. These new conditions are requiring a fundamental shift in grid planning,
                            operation, and management to meet the future needs. Additionally, the systems are expected
                            to experience significant load growth due to electrification of transportation through
                            electric vehicles, electrification of building heating loads, and the increasing power
                            demand for data centers. In addition, extreme weather events spurred by climate change are
                            putting stress on the grid and causing more frequent service disruptions.</p>

                        <p>One critical aspect for the future of the grid is the standardization of the vPAC system
                            components, such as hardware, virtual environment, protection, and control applications to
                            meet the utility industries’ current and future needs. Electrical grids often incorporate
                            various manufacturers and models of devices, making integration and scalability challenging.
                            Grid virtualization is also essential to maximize the utilization of renewable energy and
                            enable rapid adaptation. Data-driven designs, running on a virtual platform, offer insights
                            that can lead to more informed decision-making. </p>
                        <p>“Building intelligent, data-driven systems at the edge of the grid, particularly at
                            substations, is paramount,” says Prithpal Khajuria, Global Segment Leader in Energy and
                            Manufacturing Sector at Intel. “For us to more intelligently manage the grid, we need to
                            collect more data at the edge. Then we need to extract more intelligence out of the data
                            using next-generation technologies like machine learning and AI.” A new data-based approach
                            can help minimize service disruptions and mitigate the impact of climate change-induced
                            stress on the grid.</p>

                            coalition of over a dozen utilities and industry partners, including Intel, <a
                                href="">Dell</a>, <a href="">ABB</a>, <a href="">VMware</a>, <a href="">Salt River
                                Project</a>, and Southern California Edison. Its mission is to drive substation
                            digitalization by developing a standards-based, open, flexible, scalable, adoptable,
                            remotely manageable, cyber secure, and interoperable software-defined architecture for the
                            vPAC systems for the next-generation digital substations. </p>

                                        <p>“Partnerships and coalitions are invaluable for grid modernization. Intel has
                                            been driving this partnership, bringing everyone to the table with the
                                            expertise, resources, and diverse perspectives to tackle complex
                                            challenges.” — Brant Heap, Manager of PAC Strategy, Salt River Project,
                                            Chair vPAC Alliance</p>

                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>The Alliance focuses on the virtualization of protection, automation, and control systems
                            within substations, says Jesse Silva, Senior Engineer at Southern California Edison’s Grid
                            Technology Innovation (GTI) team. “The goal of the vPAC system is to convert the traditional
                            appliances that we have in substations to software defined applications. So instead of
                            physical devices, we have virtualized applications installed on a server.”</p>
                        <p>The alliance has had the opportunity to work with Salt River Project in Arizona and see some
                            positive results.</p>
                        <p>“Our work with Salt River Project shows that we can reduce the number of devices in the
                            substation by 50% and reduce the operation and maintenance cost by 76%1,” says Khajuria.
                            “This benefits the utilities on both sides, by reducing their operational cost and as well
                            as their emissions by requiring fewer maintenance truck rolls.” </p>
                        <p>Intel, with its reliable hardware and security features, provides the core technology that
                            underpins the vPAC solution layers. Dell contributes its own hardware technologies, while
                            VMware offers software-defined virtualization infrastructure. ABB, with over a century of
                            experience in the power industry, adds its power-centric technologies to the mix. </p>
                        <p>Unlike traditional fixed-function devices, vPAC-based solutions are designed to adapt to
                            changing conditions, reduce complexity, lower costs, simplify maintenance, and increase
                            reliability. Virtualized protection relays (VPR) within substations can lower cost, reduce
                            complexity, simplify maintenance, and increase reliability. The vPAC Alliance has created a
                            reference implementation guide for VPR which adheres to the IEC-61850 standard to promote a
                            resilient grid and enhances public safety, especially in cases of extreme weather
                            conditions. </p>
                        <p>Intel has been instrumental in driving the vPAC solution forward, bringing the entire power
                            sector ecosystem together to build a scalable and more secure infrastructure with focus on
                            virtualization, standardization, and interoperability. Their strategic partnership has
                            played an important role in shaping the forward-looking efforts of the broader utility
                            market.</p>
                        <p>“Partnerships and coalitions are invaluable for grid modernization,” says Brant Heap of
                            Arizona’s Salt River Project and Chair of the vPac Alliance. “Intel has been driving this
                            partnership, bringing everyone to the table with the expertise, resources, and diverse

                            provide their expertise and knowledge to form the future of grid technology,” says Jesse
                            Koskela, Product Marketing Specialist at ABB. “Nobody can do this alone.” </p>
                        <p>By adopting a forward-thinking approach, this coalition of industry leaders has set a course
                            for a more adaptive, resilient, secure, and intelligent grid that can meet the challenges of
                            the 21st century. Through these efforts, the vPAC Alliance is contributing to a more
                            sustainable and reliable energy future for energy customers worldwide.</p>
