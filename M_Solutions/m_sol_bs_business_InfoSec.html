                            IT transformation brings together people, processes, and technology. It encourages
                            stakeholders throughout your organization to rethink how IT can be used to promote
                            efficiency and cost management. IT transformation also reveals ways to simplify business
                            processes and change how applications and capabilities are delivered.

                        <p class="m_para2">
                            IT transformation is the strategy behind preparing your hardware, software, systems, and
                            practices for the challenges of both the present and the future—ensuring your business stays
                            competitive. This means more than upgrading to the latest and greatest in IT infrastructure.
                            It involves making smart investments to your compute, storage, and network layers to achieve
                            the just-right balance of cost, performance, and efficiency, with the ability to scale as
                            needed.
                        </p>
                        <p class="m_para2">
                            Accomplishing all this depends on the people in your organization. The cultural aspect of IT
                            transformation cannot be overlooked: people are one of the main pillars of a business.
                            Without building support and excitement, project leads may find that colleagues become
                            hurdles to meeting goals. When everyone shares enthusiasm for change, project managers find
                            the creative energy and resources needed to keep momentum going and to ensure IT
                            transformation success.
                        </p>
                        <p class="m_para2">
                            Thanks to new IT paradigms like cloud computing, small firms are going toe-to-toe with large
                            enterprises, sometimes with greater agility. Meanwhile, enterprises are investing in
                            advanced tools such as artificial intelligence (AI) and predictive analytics to master
                            market trends. On top of all this, businesses increasingly need to prepare for external
                            forces. For example, global health concerns like the COVID-19 pandemic require fast and
                            creative solutions to maintain productivity. Successful IT transformation will prepare
                            businesses to meet these challenges and still thrive.

You’ll also want to leverage your business relationships with any suppliers and vendors to get the ingredients you need for your specific IT transformation blueprint.

                                IT transformation is a multipronged approach with deep consideration into multiple categories of infrastructure. It involves examining the interoperability between systems, networks, and business policy. The following focus areas cover a lot of ground and can help simplify where you should direct your planning efforts.
                            </p>
                            <p class="m_para2 fw-bold">Combine Awareness Campaigns with Agile Workflows</p>
                            <p class="m_para2">
                                IT transformation is only as successful as the culture that supports it. To get people excited about change, it’s important to clearly illustrate which specific problems the transformation can solve for any given business unit. Back up awareness with Agile project management, which will allow you to demonstrate early business value with a minimum viable product. For example, <a href="" class="m_color m_underline">Intel IT used Agile to demonstrate early wins</a> in developing our updated Cyber Intelligence Platform. With Agile, Intel IT did not have to wait until the end of the project to showcase its value.

                            <p class="m_para2 fw-bold">Adopt a Hybrid, Multi-Cloud Approach</p>
                            <p class="m_para2">
                                A hybrid, multi-cloud strategy combines the best of your private cloud and public cloud resources. Private clouds, underpinned by software-defined networks (SDNs) and virtualized network functions (VNFs), abstract each of your compute, storage, and network resources into a common pool that makes it easy to allocate workloads regardless of location. By adding public cloud services from providers such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and others, you can extend beyond your IT capacity. These additional resources can help you manage seasonal spikes, maintain service-level agreements (SLAs) and uptime requirements, and focus on rapid IT delivery.
                            </p>
                            <p class="m_para2 fw-bold">Overcome Network Bottlenecks</p>
                            <p class="m_para2">
                                Overcome IT service gaps and bottlenecks by getting optimized performance from your upgraded components. For example, upgrading to the latest Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors can deliver more computational throughput. Adding Intel® Optane™ Solid State Drives helps ensure you can take advantage of this performance by avoiding bottlenecks in the storage layer.

                                By upgrading compute, storage, and network simultaneously, you can help ensure IT efficiency across your infrastructure. Intel’s <a href="" class="m_color m_underline"> Scale IT Up tool </a> helps demonstrate how addressing key upgrades in all layers produces the best-in-class performance and utilization per dollar spent.

                            <p class="m_para2">
                                To make digital transformation a reality, organizations must integrate their data architecture, operating model, compliance, and security. A strong enterprise data strategy will clearly articulate a vision for being data-centric, promote a data-oriented culture, and create “data as a service” so that employees can easily get the data they need.
                            </p>
                            <p class="m_para2">
                                One key aspect of this strategy involves channeling scattered “data puddles” from across the organization into relevant data lakes. Here, trusted data can be made available across all lines of business and business processes. Teams can analyze and share data across systems through application programming interfaces (APIs). Furthermore, analytics can apply AI and machine learning techniques to data to unlock new insights. Because data is managed and monitored across the enterprise, there’s less risk of exposure or loss.

                                Analytics and AI are driving <a href="" class="m_color m_underline"> advanced use cases</a> in every market. They’re solving complex business challenges, advancing scientific research, predicting events and consumer behaviors, and monitoring systems and production lines. Building a foundation for analytics means getting data to where it’s most needed, mainly through virtualizing and aggregating storage layers to increase data availability for scientists and developers.

                                    Purpose-built hardware is powering AI at the edge to reduce latency and offload the computational burden from the data center. For example, <a href="" class="m_color m_underline">Intel® Movidius™ VPUs</a> allow for machine vision processing in smart cameras, and <a href="" class="m_color m_underline">Intel® FPGAs</a> can be used in edge devices to support 5G and IoT deployments.
                                </li>
                                <li class="m_para2">
                                    Software and tools like the <a href="" class="m_color m_underline">Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit</a> deliver optimized performance across multiple types of hardware, giving system designers and developers more choice and flexibility for their use cases.
                                </li>
                                <li class="m_para2">
                                    For high performance computing (HPC) applications, the <a href="" class="m_color m_underline">Intel® oneAPI IoT toolkit (IoT Kit)</a> offers a common coding language for heterogeneous environments. This accelerates development time and interoperability through a “code once, deploy anywhere” methodology.
