                        <ul>
                            <li>Broadcast producers face multiple problems when it comes to covering live, remote
                                events.</li>
                            <li>Outside broadcast (OB) trucks can be expensive, require large crews, and must be
                                organized in advance. It can therefore be difficult to respond to events.</li>
                            <li>Large multi-camera broadcasts require extensive cabling that can complicate health and
                                safety, while restricting coverage to pre-cabled locations.</li>
                            <li>Mobile broadcasting via satellite or 4G offers greater freedom, but comes with
                                additional cost, bandwidth, stability, and latency issues.</li>
                        </ul>

                                viability of using 5G technology to support live, remote broadcasts—the PoC showcased a
                                live sporting event broadcast with high picture quality and low end-to-end latency.</li>
                            <li>Aviwest’s AIR320-5G transmitter, featuring Safe Streams Transport (SST) technology
                                provided a single 5G connection with the required capacity, bandwidth, and latency to
                                secure live transmission.</li>
                            <li>Telefónica deployed macro 5G coverage at 3.5 GHz and an edge computing center offering a
                                low latency environment for hosting the Streamhub production software.</li>
                            <li>A special low latency configuration of the Telefonica Core Network enabled the video

                        <ul>
                            <li>The PoC showed that with the right combination of technology, 5G offers the bandwidth,
                                latency, network capacity, and connection stability needed to support high-quality live,
                                remote broadcasts—for live sport events, or news reports, for example.</li>
                            <li>5G transmission and remote production using edge compute has the potential to reduce
                                production costs, improving total cost of ownership (TCO), and potentially boosting
                                profit.</li>
                            <p>Free of extensive cabling, equipment, and crews, broadcasters can respond more quickly to
                                events as they unfold, and take productions into places not previously possible with OB

                            Remote Event Coverage</h3>
                        <p>Today’s consumers are used to having a constant stream of information at their fingertips.
                            For media outlets, particularly news and sports broadcasters, speed and efficiency of
                            information delivery is more than just a priority—it’s the foundation of their operations.
                            In times of enormous media competition, broadcasters can’t afford to be left behind, to be
                            late, or to miss something that might be important. Oftentimes, beating the competitors
                            means taking the broadcast out of the studio into the action. Yet, news and sports producers
                            can face multiple problems when it comes to covering live, remote events with existing
                            broadcast technologies.</p>
                        <p>Outside broadcast (OB) trucks require large crews and extensive equipment, making them
                            expensive to operate and maintain. Each truck requires a generator that produces around
                            20,000W of energy to run media equipment. They’re also large in size, between five and 18
                            meters in length. Event coverage must be planned and prepared well in advance.</p>
                        <p>For some sports events, like marathons, cabling can run up to miles. Often, it’s necessary to
                            deploy cables in places where people can potentially pass or in places that are exposed to
                            wind, rain, and snow. In many situations, the wiring is so complex it requires a specialist
                            team to install and manage it. Also, the unpredictable nature of live news or sports
                            broadcasts can require the recording and transmission of scenes that are far from the reach
                            of deployed wiring.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Trialing 5G Technology to Support Live, Remote Broadcasts</h3>
                        <p>Mobile broadcasting of live events via 4G technology offers greater creative freedom.
                            However, broadcasters are still forced to make uncomfortable compromises and difficult
                            choices. Technologies that deliver the right bandwidth can limit flexibility, compromise
                            mobility, and be expensive. Yet, fully mobile, easy-to-use, and cost-effective mobile
                            technologies can’t always provide the speed, bandwidth, and low latency that is so critical
                            to live video. However, a solution is now at hand.</p>
                        <p>5G technology can help broadcasters deliver information virtually live, while capturing
                            viewers’ attention with top-quality visuals and compelling production values. Built with 5G
                            in mind, a network can theoretically offer data transfer speeds of up to 20 Gb/s download
                            and 10 Gb/s upload, far exceeding what is offered by current cellular networks and other
                            access technologies, including fiber optics1. Transmission delays of no more than 4 ms2
                            could allow production teams to broadcast live from dozens of cameras, all streaming
                            compressed 4K video in real time to a producer in another city. The producer could then
                            select the best shots using production software running on an edge cloud, before
                            transmitting footage to viewers around the world. Connection stability is also important for
                            some mobile events—it shouldn’t break down and should provide high-bandwidth data
                            transmission even at 500 km/h. 5G networks have these rates covered.</p>

                                            satellite, especially in news, has been one of the great changes in the
                                            television industry. One of the current challenges is to ensure that these
                                            transmissions are reliable enough to guarantee service. And the key to that
                                            is bandwidth and latency.”—Daniel Barroso, Telefonica Broadcasting

                        <p>However, the final element that makes 5G a game changer is its ability to support “quality of
                            service”—in other words, the capacity needed for the service to work properly. Sometimes
                            huge bandwidths aren’t required, but it’s important the network has reserve capacity for
                            when it’s needed. Technologies within 5G, like network slicing, help to ensure that capacity
                            is available.</p>
                        <p>To test the capabilities of 5G technology to support live remote broadcasting, Aviwest,
                            Intel, and Telefónica recently collaborated on a year-long proof of concept (PoC) in Madrid,
                            Spain. The aim of the trial, which was instigated by the Spanish Ministry of Economic
                            Affairs and Digital Transformation, was to design and evaluate an early-stage PoC for 5G
                            remote production capabilities, in particular multi-camera synchronization using 5G private
                            networks.</p>

                                capabilities.</em></p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Solution Details</h3>
                        <p>The PoC sought to analyze different video coding solutions in multi-camera scenarios. It
                            sought to learn whether 5G could enable broadcasters to remotely control cameras and carry
                            out live, remote video production in the cloud—see figure 1. Each video camera was encoded
                            to optimize occupied bandwidth and maintain transmission speed and video quality standards.
                            Footage was sent through the 5G access station to the 5G core, which then forwarded session
                            data on to the edge cloud, running Streamhub production software. Here, the producers were
                            able to preview the low-resolution footage sent from the remote cameras in real time. Once
                            the producer had selected the footage they wanted, a control signal was sent back to the
                            edge. From here, the final program signal was sent, encoded, to the broadcast station for
                            live transmission.</p>
                        <p>The PoC comprised the following technologies from Aviwest, Intel, and Telefónica:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>From Telefónica, macro 5G coverage at 3.5 GHz supported live outdoor reporting
                                scenarios, as well as the live retransmission of events from indoors venues like
                                theaters, auditoriums, football stadia, and conference rooms.</li>
                            <li>Intel FPGAs in the cameras provided near real-time encoding of footage.</li>
                            <li>Featuring two internal 5G modems and Aviwest’s Safe Streams Transport (SST) technology,
                                the AIR320-5G ultra-compact bonded cellular transmitter from Aviwest aggregates multiple
                                networks dynamically to adapt the video bitrate, protect stream content and support
                                retransition of lost data. However, just one 5G connection was used during the PoC, as
                                it provided the required capacity. This setup left the second 5G modem available for
                                redundancy purposes.</li>

                                servers running in an edge computing center provided by Telefónica offered an
                                environment for hosting the Streamhub production software.</li>
                            <li>The Aviwest Streamhub appliance is a high-performance transceiver designed to meet the
                                demanding requirements of broadcasting live video over unmanaged IP networks. It
                                provided high channel density for high-resolution transcoding of the live video stream.
                            </li>
                            <li>Finally, a dedicated access point name (APN) from Telefónica offered low latency access
                                to the edge computing center.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Broadcasting Over 5G Networks Reduces Costs and Increases
                            Flexibility</h3>
                        <p>The PoC showed that 5G networks can provide uplink bandwidth of hundreds of Mbps, allowing
                            high-quality video signals to be sent directly to a central studio with very low latency at
                            excellent quality. Low-latency production software hosted at the edge enabled the
                            realization and editing of video streams from multiple cameras simultaneously, enabling
                            remote TV producers to work with footage in real time to create content for live broadcasts.
                        </p>
                        <p>“For high-quality live video broadcasting over 5G, all that is needed is a compact Intel®
                            technology-based transmitter and production software running on Intel Xeon processors.
                            Expensive trucks full of dedicated equipment are no longer essential,” said Mario Buritica,
                            Business Development Manager for EMEA at Intel. “Intel’s 5G and edge computing technologies
                            can reduce costs and increase flexibility, making the live broadcast of numerous new events
                            economically feasible.”</p>
                        <p>Since far less physical equipment and cabling are needed, production teams will be able to
                            respond flexibly to situations. A reporter sent to the scene of an event will be able to
                            start a live broadcast upon arrival, straight from their terminal, be it a smartphone, a
                            computer, or a 5G-equipped camera. For pre-planned and prepared coverage, such as yacht
                            races, Grands Prix or corporate events, a 5G-based solution requires less equipment,
                            simplifying production. Less cabling improves health and safety, since there are fewer trip
                            hazards; can reduce costs; and makes possible more imaginative camera placements. This
                            greater simplicity also allows broadcasters to move quickly and can make it easier to take
                            productions into places that may have caused greater difficulty previously.</p>

                        <p>Broadcasting over 5G networks also enables simultaneous deployment to several remote locations for joint relay. Events such as marathons, processions, parades, and demonstrations can be covered more easily and cost effectively. Producers can have at their disposal transmissions from dozens of differently located cameras, rather than one or two video streams. Similarly, 5G makes parallel productions of the same event a reality, potentially boosting broadcaster revenue and profit. For example, one production team could cover a football match for two or more different broadcast clients with personalized support cameras, graphics, and even in different languages.</p>
                        <p>Finally, 5G-based solutions make possible live coverage from smaller, local events, whose budgets currently don’t stretch to traditional broadcast production methods, extending the business of live media coverage to new markets and audiences.</p>

There’s a minimum peak download rate and a minimum peak upload rate for a network to be called a 5G network, meaning that each 5G base station has to support speeds at least this fast: 5G peak download speed: 20 Gb/s (gigabits per second), or 20,480 Mb/s (megabits per second), 5G peak upload speed: 10 Gb/s (gigabits per second), or 10,240 Mb/s (megabits per second). https://www. lifewire.com/5g-speed-4180992</small></p>
                   <p> <small><sup>2</sup>5G also has a minimum latency requirement. Latency refers to the time lapse between when the cell tower sends data and when the destination device (like your phone) receives the data. 5G requires a minimum latency of just 4 ms assuming that ideal conditions are met, but could drop as low as 1 ms for some forms of communication, particularly ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC). https://www.lifewire.com/5g-speed-4180992</small></p>
