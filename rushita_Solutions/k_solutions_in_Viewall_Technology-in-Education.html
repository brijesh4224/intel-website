                        <p>For example, technology-infused active learning experiences can help teachers of any subject

                        <p>Technology can also be used to personalize learning for students. Content and the delivery of
                            that content can be adapted to the needs and learning styles of individual students. Access
                            to real-time student data can help teachers assess student progress, adjust their approach
                            at a class-wide or individual level, or inform recommendations for specific asynchronous

                            education relevant to their digital lives. With access to devices and digital resources both
                            in and outside the classroom, students are inspired to become problem-solvers, critical
                            thinkers, collaborators, and creators—and develop a lifelong love of learning.</p>
                        <p>Access to new digital learning tools, such as AI-based applications that adjust question sets
                            and feedback based on student answers or PC-based VR learning opportunities, can help
                            increase student engagement while simultaneously supporting academic development.</p>

                            technology also helps to maximize learning time and increase student engagement because both
