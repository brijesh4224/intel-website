                                As the electrical grid moves from analog to digital, nearly every device and piece of
                                equipment will require built-in, secure, interconnected intelligence. A new generation
                                of industrial computers, connected IoT sensors, and advanced data analytics, as well as
                                a supporting cloud and network infrastructure, will be needed.

                                To achieve the promise of smart grid services, four broad technology criteria must be
                                fulfilled: security, communications, analytics, and manageability.

                                    Electricity grids are large, valuable, and critical targets that require a
                                    three-dimensional approach to security—protecting hardware, securing applications,
                                    and defending against cyber threats. Embedded security solutions, such as Intel®
                                    Trusted Execution Technology (Intel® TXT) in the <a href="" class="m_ai_link">Intel
                                        vPro® platform</a> , are needed to protect the smart grid's assets and data.<br>
                                    End-to-end security solutions are also necessary to protect against attacks, detect
                                    them as quickly as possible, and take immediate corrective actions. For example,
                                    Intel security solutions help provide <a href="" class="m_ai_link">end-to-end
                                        protection across entire IoT platforms</a> with hardware- and software-fortified
                                    security that creates a chain of trust, from edge to network to cloud.<br>
                                    An additional method to combat emerging cyber threats is to virtualize and
                                    consolidate separate grid monitoring and control systems on standard, Intel®-based
                                    industrial computers. Threat management can then be performed on a single
                                    platform—resulting in both stronger and simple cybersecurity efforts.

                                    Smart grid communication involves interconnected devices and systems sharing
                                    information with each other. Different protocols, from 2G to WANs, are needed to
                                    transmit data in local networks and externally to a central location. This requires
                                    common frameworks, based on open industry standards, so grid system operators can
                                    ensure interoperable connectivity without tying their grid ecosystem to one
                                    company's solution.

                                    requires advanced smart grid technology. Intel® Xeon® processor-based servers can
                                    provide the power for these tasks with in-memory analytics capabilities that help
                                    unlock insights in seconds.

                                    Manageability covers three broad areas: equipment, software, and security.
                                    Particularly when assets are geographically dispersed or otherwise hard to access,
                                    remote diagnostic, control, and repair capabilities can dramatically increase
                                    equipment availability and reduce costs.<br>
                                    Originally built for one-way power flow from centralized generators, grids now must
                                    manage a decentralized, two-way flow that includes solar and other highly
                                    distributed energy sources. Intel®-based IoT and industrial computer systems deliver
                                    efficient monitoring and control functions to the grid edge.<br>
                                    Virtualized execution environments are another manageability solution that can allow
                                    developers to isolate different workloads, run multiple operating systems, and
                                    prevent them from interfering with one another—which safeguards millions of lines of
                                    computing code and improves control-system reliability.
