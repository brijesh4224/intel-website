                                        preferences. When you determine everything that goes into your PC from the power
                                        supply up, you know that you'll be able to play the games you want at the frame
                                        rates you want. In addition, a home-built PC keeps the door open for upgrades—as
                                        technology changes, as your gaming tastes and needs change, or as your budget
                                        allows. </p>

                                                        look for a case that's close to that size. If you're not set on
                                                        a specific size, it's better to err on the larger side. You’ll
                                                        likely find that it’s easier to work with a bigger case and will

                                                        significantly bigger isn't necessarily better: Large cases can
                                                        end up with hotspots if not properly cooled.</p>

                                                        difficult. More expensive cases may have premium and convenience

                                                        management, but these features typically won't noticeably affect

                                            instructions, we recommend you consult the manual that came with your CPU
                                            cooler.

                                        <p class="V_pv">Some coolers require a mounting bracket. The motherboard may
                                            have a bracket pre-installed; you may need to remove this bracket if your
                                            cooler doesn't need a bracket, or replace this bracket if your cooler uses a
                                            different bracket. Do this before putting the motherboard inside the case.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Some coolers come with thermal paste pre-applied to the
                                            conductive material (which sits on the CPU) and some coolers do not. If your
                                            cooler does not have pre-applied thermal paste, you will need to manually
                                            apply thermal paste before you seat the cooler. To apply thermal paste,
                                            squeeze a small dot (no larger than a grain of rice) onto the middle of the
                                            CPU. Then, place the cooler on the CPU—the pressure will spread the thermal
                                            paste adequately.

                                            oriented. Ideally, you want to orient the PSU so that its fan faces outside
                                            the case (via a vent). If your case has a vent on the bottom, you can mount
                                            the PSU upside down, so long as the bottom vent will receive decent airflow
                                            when the PC is finished.

                                            when it comes to drive bays.

                                        <p class="V_pv">You should be able to find a stack of bays in different sizes
                                            somewhere inside your case. They may have little plastic switches, in which
                                            case they are tool-free bays, or they may just look like metal brackets.

                                        <p class="V_pv">Storage generally comes in two sizes, 2.5-inch (HDDs and SSDs)
                                            and 3.5-inch (HDDs). Most 3.5-inch bays can accept 2.5-inch drives, but not
                                            vice versa (some 3.5-inch bays will have trays that aren't designed for
                                            2.5-inch drives, but they can still fit 2.5-inch bays). You may also see
                                            larger bays in your case—these are for larger drives such as optical drives
                                            and are usually located in the front of the case, near the top.

                                        <p class="V_pv">If you have tool-free bays, each bay will have its own plastic
                                            lever or switch. Open or unlock the lever or switch and you should be able
                                            to pull out the tray. Place your drive in the tray—some 3.5-inch trays will
                                            be designed to accept 2.5-inch trays. If they are, you'll need to screw the
                                            2.5-inch drive to the 3.5-inch tray so it doesn't move around.

                                                drive in one of these "bays," all you have to do is slide the drive
                                                between the metal bracket and the side of your case and screw it into
                                                place. Use as many screws as the chassis manual recommends, but if you
                                                don't have enough screws most drives will be fine with just two screws.

                        any product warranties and reduce stability, security, performance, and life of the processor

                    <p class="mb-2" style="font-size: 12px;"><sup>3</sup> Nearly 3X Faster: 802.11ax 2x2 160MHz enables
                        2402Mbps maximum theoretical data rates, ~3X (2.8X) faster than standard 802.11ac 2x2 80MHz
                        (867Mbps) as documented in IEEE 802.11 wireless standard specifications, and require the use of
                        similarly configured 802.11ax wireless network routers.

                    <p class="mb-2" style="font-size: 12px;"><sup>4</sup> Wi-Fi 6 ‘~75% Latency Reduction’ is based on
                        Intel simulation data (79%) of 802.11ax with and without OFDMA using 9 clients. Average latency
                        without OFDM is 36ms, with OFDMA average latency is reduced to 7.6ms. Latency improvement
                        requires that the 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) router and all clients support OFDMA. For more information,
