                                <p>Many factors are driving the need for a modernized power grid that can dynamically and efficiently manage how we generate, distribute, and consume energy. Some factors include:</p>
                                <p class="mb-0">&nbsp;</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Global electricity demand is projected to increase 2.5x by 2050.<sup>1</sup></li>
                                    <li>Electricity generation from renewable sources, like solar, wind, water, and distributed energy resources (DERs), including solar panels and wind turbines, is rapidly expanding.</li>
                                    <li>Traditional, centralized power plants with one-direction transmission cannot adequately support growing demand, and new bidirectional power transmission needs to and from distributed sites.</li>
                                    <li>Existing infrastructure—a patchwork of siloed, aging systems with limited manageability—severely limits visibility and control across systems, the potential of automation to dynamically balance supply and demand, and efficiency improvement efforts to meet decarbonization goals and manage costs.</li>
                                    <li>Aging infrastructure also increases the cost of monitoring, maintenance, and upgrades, opening up potential vulnerabilities in the security perimeter.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The smart grid—an interconnected network of technologies with digital control, analysis, monitoring, and telecommunications capabilities—offers a path to a more intelligent and responsive energy system to address these and other challenges and unlock new capabilities.</p>
                                <p>The introduction of virtualization and software-defined networking, intelligence brought to IoT devices, and advanced connectivity enables two-way communication with shared data access among disparate systems across the energy supply chain. <a class="b_special_a1" href="/rushita_Solutions/k_solutions_Industries_view-all_(AI)-in-Retail_Artificial-Intelligence.html">Artificial intelligence (AI)</a>&nbsp;and <a class="b_special_a1" href="/darshit/dk_product/What_Is_Edge_Computing.html">edge computing</a>&nbsp;unlock near-real-time data collection and analysis.
