                            today. There’s a logical reason for that. An infrastructure needs to be able to support the
                            largest amount of storage and the highest performance demands that could potentially be
                            required for any specific server or application. In fact, both storage
                            performance-utilization and storage capacity-utilization rates are low to very low across a
                            typical deployment. As a result, storage solutions are evolving quickly to address those
                            shortfalls and meet each customer’s specific requirements. </p>
                        <p class="my-3">Finanz Informatik Technologie Service (FI-TS) is a cloud service provider (CSP)
                            serving leading financial services and insurance companies in Germany. These large
                            institutions have massive databases and offer services that demand high levels of
                            performance and require secure infrastructure services that can meet those demands while
                            decreasing costs. Eliminating underutilized storage capacity while being able to scale data
                            efficiently—without compromising performance or flexibility—is critical to reaching that
                            goal. Faced with these challenges, FI-TS turned to Lightbits Labs and Intel to help develop
                            an effective solution.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <h2>The Storage and Container Challenge</h2>
                        <p>The FI-TS DevOps team was engineering the company’s Kubernetes-based Finance Cloud Native
                            production interface to deliver cloud-native services built on an internally engineered NVM
                            Express (NVMe)-based infrastructure. The solution’s most critical requirement was that it
                            had to meet European Union (EU) and German data-compliance laws, including data-storage
                            regulations and financial regulations set by Germany’s federal financial supervisory
                            authority, BaFin. Any persistent storage would need to meet those requirements.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, meeting those critical requirements was a substantial challenge within the
                            FI-TS Kubernetes environment because of the direct-attached NVMe storage that the company
                            was using at the time. Kubernetes orchestration allowed for local persistent volumes (on
                            NVMe), but these afforded no data protection and required applications to offer their own
                            high availability. Otherwise, containers that moved to another server would not have access
                            to their previously written data. What was needed was a centralized, redundant storage
                            solution that performed like local NVMe, worked with containers, and met BaFin requirements
                            for data protection and retention. </p>
                        <p>FI-TS was also experiencing inefficiencies with storage and resource utilization because it
                            isn’t possible to scale storage independently from compute power with the legacy DAS that
                            the company had in place. FI-TS had looked at several alternative solutions—including
                            traditional data center storage solutions—to solve these problems, but the cost structures
                            didn’t align with the company’s business case.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Handling High Availability</h2>
                        <P>Given the industries it serves, FI-TS needed persistent storage that could deliver high
                            availability at local flash performance rates. The solution also had to be engineered to
                            integrate with the orchestration layer and tightly integrate with Kubernetes using the
                            common storage interface (CSI) specification. Finally, because multiple institutional
                            customers would be using the platform, the solution had to support multitenancy while still
                            helping to ensure compliance with the stringent EU and German financial and privacy
                            regulations.</P>
                        <P>With these needs in mind, FI-TS turned to <a href="">Lightbits Labs</a>, an Intel partner.
                            Lightbits
                            pioneered the NVMe over TCP (NVMe/TCP) standard embodied in LightOS, which enables full
                            cloud-native persistent storage integration for Kubernetes, with unprecedented scaling and
                            availability via clustering. With an optimized NVMe/TCP front end and an intelligent
                            back-end flash management, LightOS delivers input/output operations per second (IOPS). That,
                            from an application’s perspective, is indistinguishable from direct-attached NVMe solid
                            state drives (SSDs). Lightbits and Intel continue to work together to promote NVMe over TCP
                            and deliver cloud-native storage for data centers that’s scalable, efficient, and easy to
                            use.</P>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Defining Success</h2>
                        <p>Recognizing that Lightbits and Intel could help it overcome the obstacles it faced, FI-TS
                            began the collaboration by defining the solution requirements, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reduced storage footprint, with the scalability to grow with evolving needs</li>
                            <li>Persistent storage capabilities for cloud services that delivered high availability to
                                institutional customers building their infrastructures</li>
                            <li>A fully automated storage architecture that granted customers direct Kubernetes access
                                using APIs—specifically the CSI specification</li>
                            <li>Orchestration for a containerized-environment infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)
                                offering</li>
                            <li>NVMe technology to complement the existing infrastructure</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>After completing the initial in-depth proof-of-concept (PoC) process, FI-TS concluded that
                            the resulting cloud-native disaggregated storage solution met its critical requirements for
                            persistent storage functionality and high availability. From there, FI-TS continued to
                            collaborate with Lightbits and Intel to shape the full Intel-based production environment.

                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Putting the Puzzle Pieces Together</h2>
                        <p>Because Lightbits uses NVMe over TCP, the solution was also able to run on FI-TS’s existing
                            infrastructure, built on Ethernet and TCP/IP. That made scaling simple and efficient
                            compared to remote direct memory access (RDMA)-based protocols and other storage fabrics.
                        </p>
                        <p>Lightbits and Intel were able to deliver on FI-TS’s strict service-level agreement (SLA)
                            requirements. And the resulting Finance Cloud Native services solution integrates Lightbits
                            LightOS high-performance software-defined block storage for container volumes with a wide
                            range of Intel hardware, including the following:</p>

                        <p>The most important outcome for FI-TS was that it could now offer its customers persistent
                            storage that enables portability while performing like local flash—a leap ahead in a
                            containerized world—while staying aligned with the Finance Cloud Native services cost
                            structure. But the results went far beyond that notable innovation, with Lightbits and Intel
                            also delivering on the other key FI-TS requirements: high availability and tight integration
                            with Kubernetes using CSI. And because Lightbits uses NVMe over TCP, the solution was also
                            able to run on FI-TS’s existing infrastructure, built on Ethernet and TCP/IP. That made
                            scaling simple and efficient compared to RDMA-based fabrics or other storage fabrics.</p>

                                underlying FI-TS storage technology—LightOS software on top of the latest Intel hardware
                                technologies —gives our customers a very simple, scalable way to run high-performance
                                applications.”—Kam Eshghi, Chief Strategy Officer, Lightbits1
                            </i>
                        </div>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">LightOS Storage Makes the Difference</h2>
                        <p>With the introduction of its Finance Cloud Native service, FI-TS was able to offer a key
                            differentiator that made it clearly stand out from its competition: a fully automated,
                            API-driven, flexible, and easy-to-use deployment model for provisioning customer
                            environments. The service delivers high availability with high IOPS, low latency (even under
                            load), high bandwidth, and consistent response times.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Intelligent Flash Management</h2>
                        <p>The Finance Cloud Native service’s intelligent flash management makes it possible for end
                            customers to spin up services on bare metal in the Kubernetes environment in minutes instead
                            of days.2 The service also makes it easy to provision high-performance, software-defined
                            volumes while enjoying the advantages of thin provisioning, compression, snapshots, thin
                            clones,, and storage quality of service (QoS). LightOS’s ability to acknowledge random
                            writes in Intel Optane PMem modules and then write sequentially to the QLC SSDs also extends
                            flash endurance. Helped by Intel Optane PMem 200 series and 3rd Generation Intel Xeon
                            Scalable processors, the solution also consolidated an 8-node cluster with 704 GB per node
                            down to a 5-node cluster with 2,560 GB per node while sustaining the same number of
                            containers and the same throughput.3</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Reliability and Scalability</h2>
                        <p>LightOS automates the scaling of Kubernetes clusters. That gives Finance Cloud Native
                            customers the agility they need, including a scale-out architecture that lets them
                            independently scale storage performance or capacity, with dynamic rebalancing across the
                            storage cluster and dynamic resizing of volumes. This disaggregated approach provides
                            complete flexibility for changing the ratio of storage to compute, as needed, to meet
                            performance requirements. And reliability is built-in, with drive and server failure
                            protection, highly available management and discovery services, and the ability to serve
                            hundreds of thousands of clients with confidence.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Stepped Up Security and Complete Compliance</h2>
                        <p>Every FI-TS customer can be confident that their production environment is security-enabled,
                            as LightOS supports multiple projects and tenants with absolute separation between dedicated
                            compute servers and Lightbits storage. Finance Cloud Native customers can also rest assured
                            that their end customer’s data is highly secured in compliance with European and German
                            regulations.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Solution Drives Differentiation for FI-TS</h2>
                        <p>FI-TS has made deployment easy for its customers, thanks to the Lightbits and Intel solution.
                            That’s because the Finance Cloud Native service provides simple application environment
                            integrations and a standard TCP/IP network infrastructure without using any proprietary
                            client software. Costs are also contained by allowing for industry-standard storage-server
                            hardware.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately, FI-TS was able to improve resource utilization, drive better performance, scale
                            data more efficiently, and reduce its TCO through its collaboration with Lightbits and
                            Intel. Even better, FI-TS was able to offer a highly differentiated service that met its
                            customers’ most critical needs.</p>
