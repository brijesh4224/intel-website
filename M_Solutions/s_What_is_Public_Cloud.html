                            <p>Public cloud is a deployment model that draws on the compute resources of a <a
                                    href="../M_Solutions/m_sol_bs_Cloud_Computing.html" class="s_link_dark1">cloud
                                    service provider (CSP)</a>. The resources are delivered over the internet, as a
                                service. Public cloud deployments are typically managed on a pay-per-use basis that
                                incurs operating expenses (OpEx) but does not require an investment in hardware as a
                                capital expense (CapEx.) The user organization contracts with the CSP to gain access to
                                the servers and supporting technologies that are owned and maintained by the CSP.</p>

                            <h2 class="k_26px mt-5 fw-lighter pt-2">How Public Cloud Works</h2>
                            <p>The public cloud delivers compute resources over the internet from a CSP, such as Amazon
                                Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and many other global or regional
                                companies.</p>
                            <p>The public cloud provides a variety of computing resources in a shared environment. Each
                                user organization, based on its needs, purchases a specific type, level, and amount of
                                performance and bandwidth from the CSP.</p>
                            <p>In this multitenant architecture, many users may consume the same hardware resources.
                                Individual user organizations may choose to deploy their cloud services on
                                software-defined virtual machines or in containers to help isolate their applications
                                and data within the CSP’s infrastructure and to restrict access to authorized users and
                                customers only.</p>
                            <p>Migrating workloads to the public cloud requires a disciplined approach across the entire
                                organization. Cloud computing operations are most effective when designed and
                                implemented by a <a

                            <p>Public cloud services—in one form or another—have become a must-have in businesses of all
                                sizes. Cloud-based applications, developer platforms, and streaming services are often
                                delivered via public cloud resources, offering many flexible options for computing
                                deployment and consumption.</p>
                            <p>Because they’re so accessible and easy to scale, public cloud services offer speed and
                                agility to accelerate time to market and the flexibility to experiment with new
                                development tools, applications, and services.</p>
                            <p>The public cloud model is popular to a large degree because its up-front costs are
                                minimal and require little or no capital investment. Services are typically priced on a
                                per-use basis, making it relatively easy to adjust capacity and performance levels as
                                the organization’s needs change.</p>
                            <p>Further, public cloud service providers own and maintain all the server hardware,
                                reducing the burden on a user organization’s IT team. Small companies and startups can
                                often launch products and services in the public cloud with little to no in-house IT
                                support.</p>
                            <p>The public cloud is especially well suited for workloads that run intermittently or
                                temporarily. For example, a startup can adopt public cloud services to scale computing,
                                networking, and storage resources to meet its rapidly evolving needs without incurring
                                the expense and risk of a capital equipment purchase.</p>

                            <h2 class="k_26px mt-5 fw-lighter pt-4">Public Cloud Architecture</h2>

                            <p>Some organizations are hesitant to migrate workloads and data to the public cloud because
                                of security or privacy concerns. Individual CSPs may offer encryption and other services
                                to accommodate some <a
                                    href="../rushita_Solutions/k_solutions_Topics_Viewall_Cloud-Security.html"

                                prefer to continue running their most sensitive applications and data in a private cloud
                                environment for better control.</p>
                            <p>In some regions, countries, or industries, regulations may restrict the storage location
                                or usage parameters for sensitive data. When regulatory compliance is a critical issue,
                                a private cloud might be the preferred choice.</p>

                            <h2 class="k_26px mt-5 fw-lighter pt-4">Public Cloud vs. Private Cloud vs. Hybrid Cloud</h2>
                            <p>The public cloud is one type of cloud deployment model. While a private cloud is powered
                                by infrastructure you own, the public cloud delivers resources over the internet from a
                                CSP.</p>
                            <p>Some workloads and usage models are best suited to the public cloud, while others are a

                            <p>Thanks to the wide range of options offered by cloud service providers, <a
                                    href="../rushita_Solutions/k_solutions_To_cloud_Service-Models.html"
                                    class="s_link_dark1">public cloud service models</a> can be found or customized to
                                support almost any use case. For example, an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model
                                offers access to hardware resources, but the user organization’s IT team manages the
                                operating system, databases, and data. An IaaS model gives the user organization more
                                control, including opportunities to create virtualized environments with their own
                                virtual resources.</p>
                            <p>Another option is the Platform as a Service (PaaS) model, where the CSP hosts the
                                hardware, firmware, operating system, and tools, and the user organization takes
                                responsibility only for its own applications and data.</p>
                            <p>End user organizations face an even lower barrier to entry when adopting the Software as
                                a Service (SaaS) model in the public cloud. SaaS is commonly used to deliver business
                                applications, such as customer relationship management (CRM) or payroll. The user
                                organization engages with the SaaS provider whose software is typically delivered
                                through a web browser. The customer is responsible only for the data.</p>
                            <p>There are other types of public cloud services as well. Each arrangement can be tailored
                                to the individual needs of the user organization and the sophistication level of its IT
                                team. The common thread among public cloud services is that the user organization can
                                take advantage of an array of computing services without purchasing and maintaining the
                                server hardware.</p>
                            <p>The public cloud can be especially well suited to artificial intelligence (AI)
                                applications and workloads. AI projects often begin with experimentation and many
                                iterations before they are ready to provide any long-term value to the organization. The
                                trial-and-error processes can include multiple adjustments to hardware configurations,
                                so it would be risky to purchase servers that might not support future needs of the AI
                                solution. Deploying in the public cloud helps organizations to postpone or avoid
                                investing in capital equipment before the solution design is finalized.</p>
