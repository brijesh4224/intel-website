                        <p>Computer vision is a type of AI that trains computers to emulate how humans see, make sense
                            of what they see, and act on that processed and analyzed information. Organizations that use
                            computer vision can achieve a variety of business outcomes, including streamlined processes,
                            improved performance, enhanced customer experiences, and greater competitive differentiation
                            in their market.</p>
                        <p>Computer vision is often used for tasks that are time consuming, error prone, or nearly
                            impossible for humans to accomplish, such as defect and anomaly identification and
                            classification, machine condition monitoring, automated medical imaging analysis, and
                            disease detection. These types of tasks require organizations to monitor operations,
                            processes, or other parts of the business from multiple touchpoints, creating an enormous
                            amount of collected visual data from which insights must be extracted—often in near-real
                            time—and acted upon.</p>
                        <h5 class="fw-bolder">How Computer Vision Is Used</h5>
                        <p class="mb-4">Computer vision systems use machine learning and deep learning models to train
                            the system to recognize aspects of an image or video and make predictions about them. Types
                            of computer vision models include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Image classification </strong>for inspecting an image and assigning it a class
                                label based on the content. For example, an image classification model can be used to
                                predict which images contain a dog, cat, or angry customer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Image segmentation</strong>, for identifying objects and extracting them from
                                their background, such as isolating a tumor from surrounding brain tissue in X-ray
                                results.</li>
                            <li><strong>Object detection</strong>for scanning images or videos and finding target
                                objects. Object detection models commonly highlight multiple objects simultaneously and
                                can be used for tasks such as identifying items on shelves for improved inventory
                                management or anomalies in items on a production line.</li>
                            <li><strong>Object tracking</strong>,for tracking movements of detected objects as they
                                navigate in an environment. For example, object tracking can be used in autonomous
                                driving to track pedestrians on sidewalks or as they cross the road.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Feature extraction</strong>for isolating useful characteristics captured in an
                                image or video and sharing them with a second AI algorithm, such as search and retrieve
                                image matching. For example, feature extraction can be used to automate traffic
                                monitoring and incident detection.</li>
                            <li><strong>Optical character recognition</strong>for extracting and converting text from an
                                image into a format that a machine can read. This is often used in banking and
                                healthcare to process important documents and patient records.
                            </li>

                        <h3 class="fw-bolder">How Computer Vision Works</h3>
                        <p>Computer vision combines components like edge computing, cloud computing, software, and AI deep learning models to enable computers to “see” data collected from cameras and videos; quickly recognize specific objects, people, and patterns; make predictions about them; and take action if necessary.</p>
                        <p>Computer vision is often used for tasks that are time consuming, error prone, or nearly
                            impossible for humans to accomplish, such as defect and anomaly identification and
                            classification, machine condition monitoring, automated medical imaging analysis, and
                            disease detection. These types of tasks require organizations to monitor operations,
                            processes, or other parts of the business from multiple touchpoints, creating an enormous

                        <h5 class="fw-bolder">The Role of Convolutional Neural Networks</h5>
                        <p class="mb-4">Computer vision systems use deep learning models from a family of algorithms known as <a href="#" class="b_special_a1"> convolutional neural networks (CNNs)</a> to guide image processing and analysis. These deep learning models analyze the RGB values embedded in digital image pixels to detect identifiable patterns. CNNs can be developed to evaluate pixels based on a wide range of features—including color distribution, shape, texture, and depth—and accurately recognize and classify objects.</p>
                        <h5 class="fw-bolder">Training Computer Vision Models</h5>
                        <p class="mb-4">Before a computer vision system can be put to work, data scientists and developers must train the system’s deep learning model for its specific use case. This requires inputting large amounts of application-specific data that the model can use to recognize what it has been developed to identify. For example, for a computer vision application designed to recognize a dog, the model must first learn what a dog looks like. It does this by being trained on thousands, maybe even millions, of images of dogs of different breeds, sizes, colors, and characteristics. <a href="#" class="b_special_a1"> convolutional neural networks (CNNs)</a> to guide image processing and analysis. These deep learning models analyze the RGB values embedded in digital image pixels to detect identifiable patterns.

                        <p class="mb-4">Most commonly, training takes place in data centers or cloud environments. For especially complex training initiatives, GPUs and AI accelerators can be applied to expedite the process and better handle the increased number of parameters involved. Once the model has completed the training phase, it has the knowledge needed to interpret and infer information from digital images. The model may also be further fine-tuned or retrained over time.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">It’s also important to note that those seeking to build computer vision solutions can use off-the-shelf, foundational models as starting points for fine-tuning to accelerate development times and avoid starting from scratch.</p>

                        </h5>
                        <p class="mb-4">Once trained, computer vision models can be deployed to computer systems to perform inference and interpret conditions in the field—continuously assessing image and video data to extract insights and information. While computer vision solutions can run inferencing workloads in the cloud or data center, many organizations today are exploring edge AI applications, where computer vision models run closer to where data is generated on lightweight, optimized edge hardware or embedded devices.
                            Moving AI inferencing capabilities closer to the edge can offer several key benefits:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Increased speed and lower latency:</strong>Moving data processing and analysis to where it is generated helps speed system response, enabling faster transactions and better experiences that are vital in many computer vision applications.</li>
                            <li><strong>Improved network traffic management: </strong>Minimizing the amount of data sent over a network to the cloud can reduce the bandwidth and costs of transmitting and storing large volumes of data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Greater reliability:</strong>The amount of data that networks can transmit simultaneously is limited. For locations with subpar internet connectivity, storing and processing data at the edge improves reliability.</li>
                            <li><strong>Enhanced security:</strong>With proper implementation, an edge computing solution may increase data security by limiting data transmission over the internet.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Privacy compliance requirements:</strong>Some governments, customers, or industries may require that data being used for computer vision applications remain in the jurisdiction where it was created. Edge computing can help businesses stay compliant with such rules and regulations.</li>
                        </ul>

                                models to help systems “see” and identify objects. It uses deep learning to form neural
