                        <p>Technology has become central to students’ learning experiences and educators’ teaching
                            practices. While IT staff and school administrators work to provide PCs for each student,
                            simply giving them a device is not enough; it must be a capable PC with enough performance
                            to withstand the needs of that student. A powerful PC is a key factor for facilitating and
                            driving optimal learning, no matter if students learn in a physical classroom, at home, or
                            in a hybrid model.</p>
                        <h2 class="k_26px mt-5 fw-lighter pt-4">Benefits of PCs for Schools</h2>
                        <p><strong>Multitude of options: </strong>PCs come in a wide range of options that can fit best
                            for any age group. Decision-makers can select from multiple form factors, sizes, and
                            processor performance levels while providing their students with fast connections and high
                            quality, particularly when paired with Intel® CPUs. The best-fit PCs also come at a lower
                            total cost of ownership for IT administrators, allowing them to make one purchase and be
                            confident that those PCs will last over a longer period of time. This reduces the frequency
                            at which devices need to be replaced or refreshed while meeting the ever-evolving needs for
                            growing students.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1"><strong>Support active learning and flipped classroom environments: </strong><a
                                href="#">Active
                                learning</a> is a teaching methodology that encourages students to participate directly
                            and learn by “doing.” Similarly, the flipped classroom teaching methodology aims to increase
                            student engagement by having students complete classwork at home and participate in hands-on
                            activities in the classroom. With PCs in the hands of students—in the classroom and at
                            home—they can actively engage in coursework that encourages them to think critically, act
                            creatively, and learn effectively. While they develop technical skills by using a PC,
                            students can also expand their knowledge by developing <a
                                href="#">innovative skillsets and
                                mindsets.</a></p>

                            drastically shifted the education industry, forcing teachers and schools to adapt quickly.
                            With a capable PC for every student, students can still have access to their education and
                            collaborate in a more personalized educational space—even if their location has changed.
                            Additional technologies like interactive flat panel displays and Intel Unite® in classrooms
                            can also boost efficient learning and teaching practices, no matter where your student is

                        <h2 class="k_26px mt-5 fw-lighter pt-4">Considerations When Selecting the Right Device for
                            Student and Educator Success</h2>
                        <p>Well-performing student devices are critical for learning success. In a 2020 Intel-led study
                            with US-based K–12 schools, 92 percent of IT decision-makers surveyed reported
                            issues<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;with student devices that had a direct, negative impact on their
                            students’ ability to learn effectively. In most cases, these issues could have been avoided
                            if students had devices that were better aligned with how they would be used. When selecting
                            the right device for students and teachers, there are four key aspects that should be
                            considered:</p>
                        <h3>Performance and Age Groups</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">The best way to assess which device is needed is to consider performance needs <a
                                href="#">per
                                age group</a>.&nbsp;Will your student&nbsp;just need videoconferencing and remote
                            learning access (K–5)? Or will they need programming, coding, and digital content creation
                            applications (6–8) or even AI, machine learning, and esports applications (9–12)?&nbsp;In
                            general, more performance will be needed to support multiple applications run at the same
                            time.</p>
                        <p>In the same Intel research study, inadequate device performance was one of the most-reported
                            classes of issues. This resulted in lag and freeze-ups that kept students from fully
                            participating in class or completing timed assignments. Many devices were also unable to run
                            multiple, simultaneous applications without crashing or unable to run creative or
                            data-intensive programs needed for middle and high school students. Ultimately, this
                            resulted in some students experiencing a learning loss, where they were unable to access
                            materials, complete and submit assignments, or attend class sessions.</p>
                        <p>To get the most out of your device purchase, consider student uses now and over time so you
                            can select a device with enough power to support their needs. This chart shows how PCs with
                            Intel® processors are aligned with computing power needs for student educational activities
                            by grade level:</p>

                        <p>PC purchasing decisions often come down to a small list of specifications, including price
                            and battery life.&nbsp;However, it’s important to think about whether a device will travel
                            between home and school, if it will stay put in a computer lab, if it’s durable for younger
                            students, and if it can connect in different locations.&nbsp;While performance is a crucial
                            element when choosing a device, thinking about how and where students will use their device
                            can affect choice of form factor, size, portability, and ruggedness (durability).</p>
                        <p>Intel’s research found that IT decision-makers who are planning their future take-home device
                            purchases are now also considering durability and form factor upgrades. Features like
                            spill-proof keys, scratch-resistant displays, and heavy-duty hinges were some of the most
                            desired durability features among decision-makers. For students who learn remotely or travel
                            between home and school, portability and durability are crucial in ensuring a device won’t
                            physically break or slow down. A durable PC allows students to take their device anywhere
                            and IT administrators don’t have to worry about replacing a PC when they leave the
                            classroom. Additionally, when devices are in the hands of younger students, durability is
                            critical, so devices stay intact as they progress through the next few grade levels.</p>
                        <p>In terms of form factor, features like device weight, screen size, and touchscreen
                            capabilities for keyboard-free use were at the top of the list for younger students.
                            Spill-proof keyboards can extend device life as younger students progress to higher grade
                            levels and begin using their devices more for content creation. Larger screen sizes,
                            touchscreen capabilities, keyboards, and drawing pads were of value for older students to
                            support more-intensive apps and increase engagement. When considering the best devices for
                            each age and learning environment, PCs provide a wide range of configurations and options,
                            giving schools the choices and flexibility they need.</p>
                        <h3>Connectivity</h3>
                        <p>Connectivity is critical to student success, especially for hybrid and remote learning. If a
                            student can’t connect to the internet, they are at a serious disadvantage; it won’t matter
                            if their device has great performance, portability, and ruggedness if they can’t connect and
                            remote into class. For some families, internet access can be a costly option or not an
                            option at all.</p>
                        <p>Surveyed school administrators reported that at least a quarter of students receiving devices
                            did not have internet access at home, and more than a third of students who struggled with
                            inadequate connectivity were located in rural areas.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Additionally, IT
                            decision-makers indicated that their second highest technology investment in 2020, beyond
                            devices, was in overall infrastructure to increase bandwidth and connectivity.</p>
                        <p>Striving for equal access to education, schools are looking to provide PCs with onboard LTE
                            or hotspots to students most impacted by limited connectivity. And when connectivity is
                            available, PCs with Intel vPro® have built-in Wi-Fi 6 or be Wi-Fi 6 (Gig+) compatible,
                            offering smoother videoconferencing, faster downloads, enhanced reliability, and improved
                            performance on congested networks. Intel vPro® offers the added benefit of integrated,
                            hardware-based security features.</p>

                        <p>With remote and hybrid learning now a staple of education, IT decision-makers are forecasting
                            an increase in purchases of take-home devices, keeping manageability and security of these
                            distributed devices a key area of IT staff focus. With 1:1 models (one device per student)
                            becoming more common, it becomes even more critical to have a fleet of PCs that are easy to
                            manage remotely. Troubleshooting and routine maintenance not only hinder students’ learning
                            experiences, but can also drive up IT costs.</p>

                        <p>It’s important to think about the cost of any device purchase completely and assess how to
                            maximize value from your investment over time. Selecting well-performing devices increases
                            the longevity of an investment because they can sustain constant use and provide the
                            performance power students need as they progress through each grade.</p>
                        <p>According to Intel’s research, many schools found that devices put into use during the
                            pandemic did not have the attributes and capabilities to meet students’ needs. In order to
                            prevent IT administrators from a too-frequent refresh cycle, a higher-quality device
                            purchase can last longer, allowing students to balance workloads, stay connected, and run
                            multiple applications at once and supporting their evolving needs as they advance in school.

                        <p>Intel has a wide portfolio of devices and other technologies that can benefit schools for an
                            active learning environment. With multiple considerations like performance, form factor,
                            connectivity, manageability, security, and budget in mind, IT administrators can make the
                            best decision for their students at any age, no matter where they learn.</p>

                            help apply technology to aid in economic recovery. One example of this investment was seen
                            in Houston, Texas. In July 2020, <a
                                href="#">Intel
