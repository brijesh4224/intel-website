                                            from a former Outlook.com account, or even from your Xbox. If you don’t have

                                            user folder at C:\Users\[user]\. As you copy files to your new PC, you can

                                        support an open ecosystem so you have the ability to use a greater number of
                                        applications and peripheral accessories. Finding the ideal device comes down to
