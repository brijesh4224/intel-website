                        <p>The FCC Group—an international leader in the sectors of environmental services, end-to-end
                            water cycle management, infrastructure development and management, cement and associated
                            products, and real-estate management—was seeking to modernize its digital workplace for
                            secure, efficient remote management of its fleet of 13,000 devices. The company partnered
                            with IT consultant Inetum to design and implement a cloud-based <a href="">Intel® Endpoint
                                Management
                                Assistant (Intel® EMA)</a> solution to complement its existing <a href="">Intel
                                vPro®</a> devices. The new
                            platform enables remote management of unattended devices in industrial settings, resulting
                            in reduced downtime, improved sustainability, enhanced compliance, and significant cost
                            savings.</p>
                        <h2 class="fw-lighter">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>The FCC Group, with over a century of experience, provides public services and infrastructure
                            development in Europe, Latin America, the United States, the Middle East, and North Africa.
                            The company’s presence in more than 38 countries, in whose markets it earned 47.5 percent of
                            its revenues in the last financial year, is proof of its global expansion. The company’s
                            digital workplace platform serves 15,000 information workers across more than two dozen
                            countries in Europe, Latin America, the United States and Canada, Africa, the Middle East,
                            and Australia. As a critical factor of FCC’s core business and IT operations, sustainability
                            drove the company’s decision to transition the management of its on-premise devices to a
                            modern workplace management platform in the cloud.</p>
                        <h2 class="fw-lighter">Challenge: Finding a Safe, Sustainable Solution for Remote Management
                        </h2>
                        <p>Before embarking on its digital workplace modernization project in 2023, FCC historically
                            relied on Windows devices with Intel® processors. These came with remote management
                            capabilities—as long as the on-premise units remained connected to FCC’s network
                            infrastructure. Such a large and complex system greatly complicated the deployment and
                            management of support services, requiring field technicians to travel to user locations and
                            incurring costly downtime.</p>
                        <p>FCC works with unattended devices in highly industrial environments such as cement production
                            plants and water management facilities. These units perform their function without human
                            interaction and access to them is limited. The chosen remote management solution, Microsoft
                            Intune Remote Help, came with a major drawback: It requires user acceptance for remote
                            control. If an unattended device were to go offline in an industrial environment, the only
                            remedy would be to send a technician in person to fix it. Solving this problem would improve
                            sustainability, productivity, and safety, making it a top priority.</p>
                        <p>In 2021, FCC started conversations with Microsoft to define a strategy for modernizing its
                            digital workplace, eventually choosing IT consultant Inetum as a technology partner to
                            undertake the project. The sheer number of locations, countries, and different user profiles
                            involved added layers of complexity.</p>
                        <p>“We had always insisted on Intel processors with vPro functionality, even if we didn’t fully
                            utilize it until this modernization,” recalls FCC’s Digital Workplace and Service Desk
                            Manager Claudio Escudero. “The move to cloud-based tools highlighted the usefulness of Intel
                            vPro, especially in scenarios that Microsoft tools couldn’t fully address,” he adds.</p>
                        <h2 class="fw-lighter">Solution: Intel vPro® and Intel® EMA for Remote Management</h2>
                        <p>Based on its strategy discussions with Microsoft, FCC decided to enhance its Intel
                            vPro-enabled digital workplace platform with Intel EMA—a cloud-based solution for managing
                            devices in remote work environments. This would allow the company to remotely manage its
                            unattended industrial devices even when they weren’t connected to FCC’s network
                            infrastructure.</p>
                        <p>“I think it’s essential to define a medium-to-long-term strategy, then start your
                            transformation project in line with that strategy,” C. Escudero recommends. Switching to a
                            cloud-based solution required new remote management tools to cover all possible scenarios.
                            “Once we saw that Intel vPro and Intel EMA were aligned with our user workstation
                            modernization strategy and cloud platform management, adopting these technologies was much
                            easier,” he adds.</p>
                        <p class="mt-5"> <i>The Abu Rawash wastewater treatment plant in Egypt is a large-scale project
                                that
                                aims to reduce water pollution and combat the effects of climate change.</i></p>
                        <p>In mid-2023, FCC kicked off the project with Inetum, which included designing the solution,
                            conducting a proof of concept and deployment. The proof of concept was ready in just six
                            months, with a full rollout following soon after. The solution has been operational since
                            April 2024 and is already showing significant benefits.</p>
                        <p>“Intel vPro enables remote management of [unattended] devices without the need for on-site
                            personnel, enhancing sustainability and safety in these industrial settings,” C. Escudero
                            says. “Cloud-based management solutions offer efficiency and ease, allowing us to deploy and
                            manage our platform more effectively.”</p>
                        <h2 class="fw-lighter">Results: With Intel EMA, the Savings Are “Clear and Very Significant”
                        </h2>
                        <p>Not having to send technicians to manage unattended devices enables FCC to resolve problems
                            remotely that used to take at least a day to solve. This has had a substantial economic
                            impact, preventing work stoppages and productivity losses in factories that operate around
                            the clock. The reduction in travel to industrial sites also has clear sustainability
                            benefits.</p>
                        <p>According to C. Escudero, one of the most useful functionalities of FCC’s modernized digital
                            workplace is its out-of-band management capability. Many solutions on the market are
                            software-based and in-band, meaning devices must be powered on and connected to network
                            infrastructure via an active operating system for remote management.</p>
                        <p class="mt-5"> <i>The Alcalá de Guadaíra cement plant in Seville is a facility of Cementos
                                Portland Valderrivas, S.A.</i></p>
                        <p>With Intel EMA’s hardware-based out-of-band management, FCC’s IT teams can reach devices no
                            matter their status, even if they are powered off, disconnected from the FCC network or
                            unresponsive. “In situations where an operating system may have been corrupted and is not
                            responding, we can still connect to the device and try to solve the problem remotely,” C.
                            Escudero explains. The FCC team also values being able to make BIOS modifications and
                            firmware updates through the same cloud-based platform.</p>
                        <p>In terms of security, moving to a cloud solution allowed FCC to significantly improve
                            compliance levels for their devices. Before implementing Intel EMA, the company had a
                            compliance ratio of 75 percent, so only three-quarters of its devices met security
                            requirements. With cloud-based management, compliance has jumped to 95 percent, enhancing
                            security across the platform without the need for a direct network connection.</p>
                        <p>Claudio Escudero credits the success of FCC’s digital workplace modernization project to
                            Inetum’s expertise with Intel vPro technology, saying the entire process from design to
                            implementation went off without major issues. “For me, it’s been essential to have a
                            strategy, a strong technology partnership to help define that strategy and a provider to
                            accompany us throughout the project,” he says.</p>
                            <p>With its digital workplace now fully transitioned from on-premise management to cloudbased tools, FCC is seeing the benefits in efficiency, productivity and sustainability. “For us, the savings are clear and very significant,” C. Escudero concludes.</p>
