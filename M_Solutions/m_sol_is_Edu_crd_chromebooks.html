                            Chromebooks are laptops that run the Chrome operating system created by Google. Affordable and with high processing power and manageability that match the latest Windows and Apple devices, Chromebooks are a popular option for K–12 education. Chromebooks can support powerful configurations of memory, storage, and security, and offer personalized, interactive, and cloud-based learning experiences for students in a variety of form factors and price points. Due to the increased versatility of Chromebooks, schools are looking to refresh or replace their current devices with the latest generation of Chromebooks.

                            While IT administrators look for ways to provide students with the best device for learning outcomes, they also need devices that are easily deployable, manageable, security enabled, and affordable. With Chromebooks, IT administrators can spend less time managing updates and reacting to security threats and spend more time on other school-related IT concerns that need their attention.

                                <span class="fw-bold">Easy to deploy and manage: </span>
                                Chromebooks are specifically designed to be configured for almost any school environment. The operating system automatically updates, reducing the amount of manual maintenance required; they turn on quickly; and have several built-in security features. IT administrators can easily evaluate and test Wi-Fi coverage and establish a platform for student assessments that meet most K–12 education testing standards. Google also provides a <a href="" class="m_ai_link">deployment guide</a> and <a href="" class="m_ai_link">video series</a> that go over how to set up and deploy a fleet of Chromebooks for your school district.

                                With Intel-powered Chromebooks, there are two layers of security features: Chromebook security and Intel® processor-based security technologies. Since Chromebooks update automatically, they ensure all software is up to date with the latest security patches. While this can be difficult to do manually with a distributed fleet of devices, Chromebooks manage these security updates without additional IT support. Furthermore, when students use web apps on a Chromebook, all important data is stored in the cloud, making it difficult for any hacker or malware to access those files. With Intel® processors, Chromebooks get an added layer of hardware-based security technology that helps provide students with protection from evolving and modern security threats.

                                Particularly when powered by Intel® processors, Chromebooks come with several high-end capabilities that tend to exceed expectations for their price: built-in security, a suite of applications, a robust form factor, high processing power, and easy deployment and manageability. These capabilities can help to reduce overall maintenance and support costs and device refresh cycles.

                                Intel partnered with CTL to launch an innovative <a href="" class="m_ai_link"> Chrome as a Service (CaaS)</a> pilot with Arora Public Schools to build a sustainable and successful 1:1 program. By leveraging the CaaS model, Aurora was able to streamline the deployment of powerful Chromebook powered by Quad-Core Intel Celeron processors with Wi-Fi 6 while easing the burden on IT and establishing a turnkey 1:1 client infrastructure. Students showed increased engagement and improved learning experiences with more responsive Chromebooks, while IT staff benefited from integrated services that saved valuable time on device deployment, troubleshooting, and break-fix. Finally, the CaaS model provided a flexible monthly payment structure eliminating a large capital purchase.

                                Student devices must have enough processing power to support multiple applications and multitasking in a classroom. As students get older, their lessons will increase in complexity, and they will need to have technology at their disposal that aligns with a modern curriculum. With Chromebooks powered by Intel® technology, students can experience worry-free computing when running multiple applications and completing their day-to-day tasks. Chromebooks can offer up to 2.6x faster multitasking and 2.7x better performance,1 helping to increase student productivity and making it easier for them to connect with their teachers and fellow classmates.

                                Chromebooks can offer more than 12 hours of battery life,2 enabling students to use their Chromebook in the morning for class, in the afternoon for homework, and the evening as they relax—all without needing a charge. Also, since Chromebooks allow users to move around to different settings—from class to home—students don’t need to worry about bringing a cable or finding an outlet to charge their device.

                                Chromebooks offer flexibility for students with their laptop, convertible, and 2-in-1 form factors. With large screens and styluses, students can engage in higher-level and hands-on lessons that help them develop greater technical skills as well as more-developed skill sets and mindsets that align with the <a href="" class="m_ai_link">Skills for Innovation Framework</a>. Chromebooks come in thin and lightweight options so as not to weigh down students when traveling from home to school.

                                With remote and hybrid learning driving the demand for internet connectivity, Chromebooks keep students and educators connected everywhere as they reimagine the traditional classroom. Today, lessons require students to be connected to the internet, and with up to 3.3x faster web browsing,1 students can quickly and effortlessly attain access to information and resources as well as conduct research for school. Chromebooks are also available with a built-in LTE option for students who don’t have internet access at home.

                            It’s important to select a device with enough processing power to support the students’ use for activities at home, school, or in between. In general, if a student needs their device to run more data- or processing-intensive programs, more performance will be needed for that student’s device. Chromebooks can provide the level of performance and responsiveness that students require for their academic success, allowing them to engage and participate in their studies from anywhere.
