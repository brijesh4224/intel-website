                                    infrastructure. With integrated Intel IPM software for 5G core, Nokia has validated
                                    a 40%5 reduction in CPU power levels with zero packet loss when testing 5G user and
                                    control plane functions running on HPE ProLiant DL360 Gen 11 servers featuring Intel
                                    Xeon processors. Nokia’s results with IPM sit on top of any generation-to-generation
                                    energy efficiency improvements that come with Intel’s Xeon processors. Nokia will
                                    provide the first commercially available 5G core stack based on this capability in
                                    2024.

                                    significantly reduce the runtime power consumption of its network function
                                    infrastructure. By leveraging the Intel Infrastructure Power Management in the
                                    network and by collaborating on initiatives like the #Sylva project, the path to
                                    increased energy efficiency and lower operating costs is accelerating.

                                    software for user plane. Current lab trials are measuring over 27% CPU power savings
                                    without compromising throughput, latency or packet drop6. SK Telecom projects energy
                                    savings may exceed $10 million while accelerating progress toward net-zero targets
                                    by offsetting thousands of metric tons of carbon emissions. Samsung indicates that
                                    its 5G Core software utilizing Intel’s new processors will become commercially
                                    available in 2H 2024.
