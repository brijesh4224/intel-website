                            recommendations or make decisions based on unseen images. Software containing trained AI
                            models can process images and take action very quickly.

                            Computers can get very good at detecting, recognizing, and classifying the images they’ve
                            been trained to understand. However, this “knowledge” is difficult to transfer to other

                            Computer vision AI has the potential to execute repetitive and monotonous tasks more quickly
                            than humans can. Its assistance with <a class="mv_enhance_a" href=""> defect detection </a>
                            can lead to better products and lower

                            implementing computer vision remains challenging for organizations. Below, we’ll discuss
                            some common challenges and some ways we propose to mitigate them.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="mv_enhance_h3">First Challenge: Access to Data Scientists</h3>
                        <p class="mv_enhance_p">
                            Data scientists are essential in determining how data can be used to solve business
                            problems, gathering and analyzing data, designing data modeling processes, and creating
                            algorithms. Computer vision models depend on vast amounts of data to learn accurately,
                            making this role indispensable.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mv_enhance_p">
                            However, many, if not most, organizations do not have dedicated data scientist resources.
                            Even if they do, these skills are often in demand, and resources may be limited or stretched
                            thin due to the labor-intensive nature of traditional AI model-building.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mv_enhance_p">
                            Organizations that don’t have in-house data scientists can face an uphill battle finding the
                            right talent with the right skill-sets. Good data scientists are hard to find for two
                            reasons. For one, artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly accessible, increasing
                            demand for these professionals. For another, the wide variety of technical skills required
                            makes this a challenging field to get into, leading to a limited talent pool.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="mv_enhance_h3">Some of the technical skills required are:</h3>

                        <p class="mv_enhance_p">
                            In the face of these computer vision challenges, some organizations look inward for data
                            science talent. It is possible to train your own professionals to build computer vision
                            models, but it does take time and resources. Software engineers with an inclination toward
                            artificial intelligence or machine learning make good candidates for learning data science
                            in-house.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mv_enhance_p">
                            However, the lack of user-friendly tools and processes makes this a difficult path to tread.
                            In addition to the processes themselves, the dependencies of the tools, frameworks, and
                            libraries must be managed effectively. For this reason alone, many end up looking for data
                            scientists who can already navigate the available tools. If you could find more
                            user-friendly solutions that required little to no code, it would be possible to build
                            computer vision models in a simpler way. In this case, it would be more feasible to train
                            your own data scientists in the other skills needed without the platform as a barrier.

                            invaluable for organizations looking to solve challenging problems and develop more
                            efficient or effective solutions.

                            Data science experts know the technology needed to train the computer vision model. They
                            understand working with large data sets and how to visualize the data. In many cases, domain
                            experts work closely with the use case for that particular model, as well as the nuances of
                            that particular business problem. While domain experts are experts on their own subject,
                            they don’t necessarily have extensive knowledge about artificial intelligence, let alone
                            computer vision.

                        <h3 class="mv_enhance_h3">The Benefits of Collaboration Between Data Science and Domain Experts
                        </h3>
                        <p class="mv_enhance_p">
                            Ideally, both data scientists and domain experts will collaborate to build an accurate
                            model. This collaboration makes the AI model training process much more accurate and faster
                            since domain experts are familiar with the data for their particular use-case. Domain
                            experts also play an important part in testing. They can analyze results to see if the model
                            is really working as needed or if further adjustments or a whole new direction are required.
                            Additionally, increased collaboration with domain experts can ease pressure on often limited
                            artificial intelligence and data science resources.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mv_enhance_p">
                            The knowledge transfer goes both ways. Just as domain experts inform the training and
                            testing process, data scientists help them understand the solution they are creating. A good
                            understanding of the technology allows domain experts to best apply the solution to their
                            business needs.

                        <p class="mv_enhance_p">
                            However, despite the benefits of collaboration, it doesn’t always happen as much as it
                            should. For one thing, data science and machine learning professionals use different kinds
                            of tools than domain experts. They may also have different levels of expertise. Both of
                            these fields are complex and take years of experience to learn the respective skills.
                        </p>

                            It’s also incredibly challenging to be both a data science expert and domain expert. Both

                        <p class="mv_enhance_p">
                            There is simply a huge amount of time and effort required to build, train, and test a

                        <p class="mv_enhance_p">
                            No matter how simple the intended results, computer vision models need a large amount of
                            data in order to be trained. Choosing the right kind of data isn’t enough. Typically every
                            piece of data used in training must be labeled manually so that the model can build a
                            foundation for understanding what it is “seeing.”
                        </p>
                        <p class="mv_enhance_p">
                            For computer vision, this usually means labeling key points, pixels, or images, or creating
                            the bounding box that encloses the digital space you want the computer to look at. Some
                            sources say <a class="mv_enhance_a" href="">80% of an AI project </a>will be dedicated to
                            collecting, organizing, and labeling

                            Accuracy and bias testing also take time. It’s becoming clear that more testing is needed to
                            really know if an AI model is giving the intended results for the right reasons or not.
                            Underspecification is always a risk when building computer vision AI models. This happens
                            when there are many ways for a model to perform a certain way on a test set, meaning the
                            observed effects could have a variety of possible causes.

                            This is one common explanation for why many models seem to test well but don’t work in the
                            real world. According to <a class="mv_enhance_a" href="">Google</a>, underspecification
                            happens a lot more than we’d like. Even
                            more stress tests on a large number of examples are needed to mitigate this

                            Whenever a model shows less-than-accurate results, iteration is necessary. The
                            labor-intensive nature of data wrangling and model testing is exacerbated in traditional
                            computer vision AI models by the need to repeat a lot of the process steps to retrain the
                            model each time the algorithm needs to be adjusted or new data sources emerge.

                            Companies can also outsource annotation if the time and labor needed are too much to be
                            handled internally. However, this solution comes with its own challenges, including cost and
