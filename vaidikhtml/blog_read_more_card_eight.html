                            Computer vision tasks can be broadly categorized into several types, each serving a unique
                            purpose. Broadly, there are three sub-categories based on how much supervision is provided
                            about the data and the regions of interest in the data:

                            Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled
                            data, meaning each input sample is associated with a corresponding target label. In the
                            context of computer vision, supervised learning tasks include:
                        </p>

                            <b>Image Classification:</b> Image classification is the task of assigning a label or
                            category to
                            an entire input image. For example, classifying images of animals into different species or
                            identifying objects in a photograph. There can be multiple categories of image
                            classification, where an image may be assigned just a single label or class, or in another
                            situation, an image may be associated with multiple types of objects, and thus, assigned
                            multiple labels or classes. Such a computer vision model learns from the characteristics of
                            the labeled data and helps identify the specific classes it was trained for.

                            <b>When to Use:</b> To say it simply, image classification is suitable when you want to
                            determine
                            what is in an image, but you don’t need to know the precise location of objects. It is
                            commonly used in applications like content-based image retrieval, sentiment analysis from
                            images, and identifying diseases from medical images.

                            within an image – i.e., identifying where the object is in the image. It goes beyond image
                            classification by not only identifying objects but also drawing bounding boxes around them.

                            tasks and helps identify segments of interest in an image by its shape – i.e., how it is
                            shaped. This task is often used for object localization and focuses on identifying the exact
                            shape of the objects or regions of interest, allowing for in-depth image analysis.

                            the same category, but an instance segmentation task does and thus is more suited for object
                            counting tasks as well.

                            autonomous vehicles, and instance segmentation in industrial defect detection – such as for

                        <p class="mv_enhance_p">Supervised learning tasks are helpful when we know what we are trying to

                            objects. However, often we have scenarios where we may not even know what the type of
                            objects or situation we are trying to identify may look like. Consider a production line
                            example, developing a new product – it is not clear what the defects may look like, and a
                            camera monitoring the product line may mainly be seeing images of normal products. A
                            semi-supervised learning task can be very helpful to address such scenarios.

                            normal data is supplied for model training. And, when the model sees anomalous data, that
                            deviates from the patterns it has learned from the normal data, it identifies the anomalies.
                            It is commonly used for defect detection in manufacturing or identifying anomalies in

                            Intel Geti software allows users to build multiple types of classification projects, based
                            on their use cases – single-label classification, multiple-label classification, and
                            hierarchical classification. A single-label classification task allows users to train a
                            binary or multi-class classification model that can learn about identifying the presence of
                            one object type (or class) in each image. The model may be trained to identify many
                            different objects (at least two for a binary classification task), but it can associate each
                            image with only one object or class. A multi-label classification, on the other hand, can
                            associate each image with more than one object or class. A hierarchical classification task
                            can learn about parent-child relationships for different types of classes that may be
                            present. These classification tasks also allow users to analyze saliency maps and heat maps,
                            thereby being able to understand and explain what the model is learning from.

                            software. You may have multiple objects belonging to the same class in a given image. As
                            described earlier, a semantic segmentation task will group objects belonging to the same
                            entity or class, while an instance segmentation task allows you to identify them as
                            individual objects, as separate entities, and enable you to count them. For example, if you
                            have an image with multiple people, a semantic segmentation will group them and recognize
                            them collectively as people, without differentiating the individuals. On the other hand, an
                            instance segmentation-type task will enable identifying every individual in the given image.

                            free-hand drawing, while an interactive segmentation feature enables quick delineation by
                            just dropping a dot in the positive or negative region of a specific object – in other

                        <p class="mv_enhance_p">
                            Intel Geti software supports three types of semi-supervised learning tasks. All of these are
                            anomaly-based tasks and can be categorized as anomaly classification, anomaly detection, and
                            anomaly segmentation. The main idea behind these tasks is that the model only learns from
                            the data provided as normal data and tries to make predictions on the anomalous data. As
                            described in the previous section, such semi-supervised learning methods are extremely
                            useful when obtaining large amounts of anomalous data or data with defects is very
                            difficult. Defect detection use cases or healthcare use cases are common examples where such
                            tasks prove extremely helpful. In Intel Geti software, the same dataset can be used to build
                            either anomaly classification – where the model only classifies whether an input image is
                            anomalous or normal, anomaly detection – where the model uses the information and localizes
                            the anomaly, and anomaly segmentation – where the model delineates the shape of the anomaly.

                            Additionally, Intel Geti software provides the ability to build chained tasks – where it may
                            not be possible to train a single neural network model to solve the problem easily. Breaking
                            tasks in this way also enables a better collaboration experience. For example, a radiologist
                            may be able to identify a tumor from the CT scan images, but classifying those tumors to be
                            benign or malignant will need inputs from a cancer specialist (or oncologist). In such a
                            situation, it will be prudent to build a first-level model to localize the tumor and a more
                            dedicated model to classify the specific localized tumor.

                            This is often the case in many real-world use cases where a combination of multiple computer
                            vision models is used to solve a complex problem, and output from a model is fed as an input
                            into the subsequent neural network. There may be additional pre- and post-processing steps
                            needed in such scenarios. Intel Geti software provides two types of task-chain templates – a
                            detection and classification task chain, and a detection and segmentation task chain. The
                            platform also takes care of all the pre-and post-processing steps in between these tasks,
                            making it easier for users to solve their complex problems.
