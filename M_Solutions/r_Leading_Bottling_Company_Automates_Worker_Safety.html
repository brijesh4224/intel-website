                        <p>Highly automated factories deliver enormous benefits for manufacturers. Yet machines,
                            equipment, and automation represent genuine risks. Add humans to the mix, and the stakes get
                            higher.</p>
                        <p>Humans are prone to errors. They get tired, become distracted, and occasionally make mistakes
                            and miscalculations. An inability to adhere to occupational safety guidelines can lead to
                            employee injuries—and worse.</p>
                        <p>For manufacturers, these errors and inefficiencies add up. They boost costs, undermine
                            productivity, pose regulatory and reputational risks, and put workers at further risk. The
                            result? Falls, slips, burns, cuts, bruises, blunt force injuries, and numerous other
                            problems.</p>
                        <figure>

                        <p>With the C3 Private Cloud, C3 Group gives clients the option of colocation or
                            Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) via shared or dedicated servers, built to suit their
                            needs. The C3 Private Cloud also serves as the foundation for the group’s DNS, web hosting,
                            offsite cloud backup, hosted security, hosted telephony services, secure private networks,
                            and Internet services.</p>
                        <p>Brian Townley, general manager of C3 Group, elaborates: “The cloud delivers unparalleled
                            flexibility and scalability, and is now seen as a mature technology. Internet services in
                            Australia have improved a lot in the last few years, which has made cloud services more
                            accessible and more attractive to businesses. Demand for cloud has never been higher.”</p>
                        <figure>

                        <p>C3 Group is continuously innovating and modernizing its service portfolio to deliver
                            increased scale, agility, and innovation to clients. To meet the surge in demand for cloud
                            services, C3 Group looked to replace its existing hosting platform—a rigid three-tier
                            architecture—with hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI).</p>
                        <p>“HCI combines compute, storage and networking components with virtualization software in one
                            box,” says Brian Townley. “HCI appealed to us, as we wanted to decrease the complexity and
                            increase the scalability of our data center. We looked at the leading HCI solutions on the
                            market and the Lenovo ThinkAgile MX platform caught our eye.”</p>
                        <p>Lenovo ThinkAgile MX Certified Nodes are HCI building blocks that come with Microsoft Windows
                            Server* 2019 Datacenter Edition, Microsoft Storage Spaces Direct, and Microsoft Azure Stack
                            HCI* software built in. Compute, storage, and networking are virtualized and pooled across a
                            cluster of Lenovo ThinkAgile MX nodes, making it easy to deploy, manage, and scale the
                            infrastructure. Featuring 2nd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors, the ThinkAgile MX
                            platform delivers consistently high performance and boasts silicon-enabled security built
                            into the processors.</p>
                        <p>Impressed with the simplicity and easy scalability of the proposed HCI solution, C3 Group
                            decided to rebuild its private cloud environment on the Lenovo ThinkAgile MX platform.</p>
                        <p>“We have worked with Lenovo for many years now, and our experience of both the technology and
                            the support has always been excellent,” says Townley. “We’re running mission-critical
                            workloads for clients, so it’s crucial that we have local support on hand. Lenovo’s 24/7
                            service offering with four-hour response time was a key deciding factor. Knowing that we can
                            get spare parts and engineers on site quickly whenever issues arise gives us great peace of
                            mind.”</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../img/Monika_img/c3-4.jpg" alt=""
                                style="width: 100%; object-fit: cover; box-sizing: border-box;">
                        </figure>
                        <p>C3 Group worked with Lenovo consultants to come up with a system design that met both its
                            current and projected future requirements. Townley recalls: “The dedication of the Lenovo
                            team really shone through. They were very willing to keep tweaking the system design until
                            we were completely happy with it.”</p>
                        <p>Next, C3 Group implemented the nine-node ThinkAgile MX cluster and set about migrating client
                            environments to the new infrastructure. “The implementation went very smoothly,” recalls
                            Townley. “Since the nodes come with the Microsoft software pre-installed and pre-configured,
                            getting everything set up in our data center was very straightforward.”</p>
                        <p>Today, the Lenovo ThinkAgile MX platform underpins the C3 Private Cloud, which in turn
                            supports their extensive portfolio of colocation, IaaS, and hosted services. With the
                            Microsoft Azure Stack HCI solution, C3 Group is also able to replicate Azure and Storage
                            Spaces Direct environments on clients’ own hardware in their own data centers, with a
                            connection to the C3 Private Cloud for back-up and security services. What’s more, the
                            Lenovo ThinkAgile MX platform offers seamless integration with public Azure cloud services,
                            such as Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery, Azure Monitor, and Azure Update Management.</p>
                        <p>Townley notes: “We work very closely with clients to determine the best place to host their
                            workloads, be it on-premises, in the C3 Private Cloud or in the public cloud. The Lenovo
                            ThinkAgile MX platform gives us the flexibility we need to meet clients’ diverse
                            requirements, not just one-size-fits-all, cookie-cutter solutions. Having our own private
                            cloud also means that we can provide a complete solution at a competitive price.”</p>
                        <p>C3 Group can also offer its clients extremely competitive service levels. Equipped with 2nd
                            Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors, the Lenovo ThinkAgile MX platform is a clear improvement
                            on the group’s legacy systems. “Thanks to the powerful Intel Xeon Scalable processors, the
                            new HCI solution delivers a 300% performance increase,” says Townley. “This enables us to
                            provide an even better service, keeping existing clients satisfied and helping us to win new
                            business.”</p>

                            between our various sites. Due to the success of C3 Group’s reliable and performant solution
                            backed by excellent service, we have since migrated our primary server infrastructure to
                            C3’s Private Cloud offering. We have great peace of mind knowing our business is utilizing
                            industry leading technology. Our continued partnership with C3 Group has been very positive

                            tried partnering with larger commercial companies to help with this, but now being partnered
                            with C3 Group, there’s just no comparison.”</p>
