Within a single system or across multiple systems, on-premises, or augmented with the cloud, HPC is more accessible than ever before.</h4>
                        <h3 class="fw-light mt-5 pt-5" id="key1">Why Is HPC Important?</h3>
                        <p>High performance computing (HPC) is not new. HPC workstations and supercomputers have played an integral role in academic research for decades, solving complex problems and spurring discoveries and innovations.</p>
                        <p>In recent years, the quantity of data has proliferated rapidly, and many new applications benefit from the power of HPC—that is, the ability to perform computationally intensive operations across shared resources—to achieve results in less time and at a lower cost compared to traditional computing. At the same time, HPC hardware and software have become more attainable and widespread.</p>
                        <p>Scientists, engineers, and researchers rely on HPC for a range of use cases, including weather forecasting, oil and gas exploration, physics, quantum mechanics, and other areas in academic research and commercial applications.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-light mt-5 pt-5" id="key1">How Does HPC Work?</h3>
                        <p>While HPC can be run on a single node, its real power comes from connecting multiple HPC nodes into a cluster or supercomputer with parallel data processing capabilities. HPC clusters can compute extreme-scale simulations, AI inferencing, and data analyses that may not be feasible on a single system.</p>
                        <p>Some of the first and most prominent supercomputers were developed by Cray and IBM, which are now Intel® Data Center Builders partners. Modern supercomputers are large-scale HPC clusters made up of CPUs, accelerators, high-performance communication fabric, and sophisticated memory and storage, all working together across nodes to prevent bottlenecks and deliver the best performance.</p>
                        <h3>Scaling Up Performance</h3>
                        <p>HPC applications take advantage of hardware and software architectures that spread computation across resources, typically on a single server. Parallel processing within a single system can offer powerful performance gains, but applications can scale up only within the limits of that system’s capabilities.</p>
                        <h3>Scaling Out Performance</h3>
                        <p>When multiple systems are configured to act as one, the resulting HPC clusters enable applications to scale out performance by spreading computation across more nodes in parallel.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-light mt-5 pt-5" id="key1">Benefits of HPC</h3>
                        <p>HPC is gaining acceptance in academia and in the enterprise as demand grows to handle massive data sets and advanced applications. And with the advent of highly scalable, high-performance processors and high-speed, high-capacity memory, storage, and networking, HPC technologies have become more accessible. Scientists and engineers can run HPC workloads on their on-premises infrastructure, or they can scale up and out with cloud-based resources that do not require large capital outlays.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="fw-light mt-5 pt-5" id="key1">HPC Use Cases</h3>
                        <p>Today, research labs and <a href="/content/www/us/en/high-performance-computing/overview.html">businesses rely on HPC</a> for simulation and modeling in diverse applications, including autonomous driving, product design and manufacturing, weather forecasting, seismic data analysis, and energy production. HPC systems also contribute to advances in precision medicine, financial risk assessment, fraud detection, computational fluid dynamics, and other areas.</p>
                        <h2>HPC Components</h2>
                        <p>The most productive high performance computing systems are designed around a combination of advanced <a href="/content/www/us/en/high-performance-computing/hpc-products.html">HPC hardware and software products</a>.
