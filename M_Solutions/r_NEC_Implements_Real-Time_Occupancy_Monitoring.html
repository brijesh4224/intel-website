                        <p>As one of the U.K.’s largest event venues, the NEC in Birmingham, England, hosts a wide
                            variety of conferences, performances and exhibitions. The NEC Group operates two arenas and
                            two conference centers with 190,000 m2 (2 million sq. ft.) of floor space spanning 18
                            interconnected halls and 32 conference suites—plus several outdoor event spaces.</p>
                        <p>“What makes us unique is our ability to diversify so we can host many different profiles of
                            events—from trade events to public events to arena shows to sporting events,” explained
                            Robert Bowell, IT PMO Manager at NEC Group.</p>
                        <p>NEC has always been able to track overall attendance at events. During the pandemic, the team
                            recognized they also needed the ability to accurately monitor occupancy and manage capacity
                            throughout their diverse event spaces in real time. Accurate insights on the location and
                            movement of guests help them ensure the safety and security of the 3 million people who
                            attend events at the NEC annually, increase operational efficiency and optimize guests’
                            experiences.</p>
                        <p>The same adaptability that makes NEC so appealing as an event venue also makes building an
                            occupancy monitoring solution challenging. Unlike locations with static entrances, exits,
                            and spaces, such as retail environments or airports, the venue’s configuration and flow of
                            people inside the NEC can be vastly different on any given day. </p>

                            <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left me-4" style="font-size: 100px; color: #E5E6E6;"></i><i>“We
                                are a massive venue. We attract over 3 million visitors a year. Security is a key
                                priority for us.” —Robert Bowell, IT PMO Manager at NEC Group</i>
                        </div>
                        <p> “Every event is a different buildup. It could be Halls 1 to 5 one day, Halls 1, 2, and 3
                            another day. The capacity is different. The profile of the event is different. We had some
                            unique requirements,” Bowell said. “One day, an entrance can be an exit. One day, that
                            entrance might not be open ... What we were looking for is to be able to count people in
                            real time in and out of our hall space, not just based on the static walls, but also across
                            an event.”
                        </p>
                        <p>NEC required a fast, flexible, and intelligent solution that could accurately identify and
                            track guests’ entrance, movement, gathering, and exit across an unlimited number of possible
                            event space configurations. The solution would need to provide live occupancy data for
                            events with over 50,000 attendees with 95%+ accuracy and immediately alert staff about
                            capacity breaches.</p>

                        <p>The NEC Group worked with Intel and Detroit, Michigan-based WaitTime to develop an AI-driven
                            crowd intelligence solution built for its unique and dynamic requirements. WaitTime’s
                            proprietary AI technology uses Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) video feeds from Cisco
                            Meraki smart cameras installed overhead throughout NEC facilities. The company used the
                            <a href=""> Intel® oneAPI toolkit</a> to optimize heterogeneous workloads for the highest
                            possible
                            performance.
                        </p>
                        <p>“Our system is a data stream that goes directly into the venue—untranslated,” explained
                            Zachary Klima, Founder and CEO of WaitTime. “Now what we’ve done is created this translation
                            layer between the core product of WaitTime and the end user. It allows us to tell a story
                            how they can improve their operations based on the insights that we provide them.”</p>

                        <p>Using the Operations Dashboard, the NEC Group can easily define the entrances and exits in
                            use for any given event, giving the team the flexibility to customize how the system tracks
                            attendee behavior for different events and venue configurations.</p>
                        <p>The solution runs on servers powered by 5th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors with
                            built-in AI acceleration. This system allows visual data processing and computer vision
                            inferencing to occur on-site at the NEC, delivering latencyfree AI performance without
                            needing specialized hardware.</p>

                        <p>The NEC Group’s new occupancy monitoring solution also provides a powerful analytics platform
                            in the WaitTime Analytics Dashboard. The Analytics Dashboard gives NEC instant insights and
                            a wealth of valuable analytical insights derived from past guest activities and movement
                            patterns.</p>
                        <p>“WaitTime recognized that there is a need to look more in depth at that data … We can compare
                            event by event, year on year, and hall by hall. We can now look at this data historically in
                            a real-time dashboard as opposed to fixed reports, so we can make real-time operational
                            decisions,” said Bowell. “Understanding our traffic flow, knowing if we have enough catering
                            units. Also, thinking about security, understanding how we schedule security staff. It’s
                            going to drive a lot of key decisions for us.” </p>

                        <p>With the occupancy monitoring system in place, the NEC Group has better-informed responses
                            and strategies for the operations needs of different types and sizes of events. It can
                            capture accurate crowd data for large events, receive automated capacity alerts and gain
                            insights that allow the team to flexibly deploy the right level of resources and staff in
                            real time.</p>
                        <p>“WaitTime does exactly what we need. It automates and integrates with our event management
                            system so we can get real-time numbers of who’s in the hall at any one time,” said Bowell.

                            looking at what they can build upon this AI-powered foundation in the future. NEC’s WaitTime
                            system can be expanded to include additional features and capabilities, such as WaitTime’s
                            queueing algorithm, which helps minimize the time guests spend waiting in line. The WaitTime
                            system can also integrate with the venue’s digital signage or mobile app to drive
                            smartwayfinding features, open seat information and provide other insights that improve
                            guest experiences.</p>

                                style="font-size: 100px; color: #E5E6E6;"></i><i>“We’re excited to scale worldwide to
                                bring our artificial intelligence everywhere. The partnership with Intel allows us to do
                                that. It would not be possible without it. So that’s what we’re the most excited about,
                                is to scale into every single country and every single large venue in the world that can
                                benefit from WaitTime.” —Zachary Klima, Founder and CEO of WaitTime</i>
                        </div>
                        <p>In addition, the NEC Group can collect analytics from a wide range of crowd scenarios and
                            offer exhibitioners and event organizers detailed attendee data reports to help inform event
                            planning and business practices. These capabilities allow the NEC Group to empower
                            exhibitioners with better data and the opportunity to add data-as-a-service as a new source
                            of revenue.</p>
                        <p>“We try to accumulate as much data as possible to support our decisions as organizers.
                            Interpreting this information enables us to both improve our shows for attendees and develop
                            them in a way that is beneficial and profitable for all of our stakeholders, partners, and
                            customers,” confirmed Chris Asselin, Co-founder and CMO at UK Metals Expo.</p>
                            <p>By optimizing its software to run on Intel® hardware, the future also looks bright for WaitTime. Plus, since they built with oneAPI, WaitTime’s developers can be confident that their code will reliably port and scale across existing and future CPU, GPU, and AI accelerator architectures.</p>
