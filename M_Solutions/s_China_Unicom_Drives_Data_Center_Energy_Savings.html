                        <p>China has clearly outlined the “dual carbon” goals of peak carbon by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. In addition to lowering environmental pressures, the achievement of these dual carbon goals also serves as a prerequisite for sustainable development. In order to better respond to national policies, promote the sustainable development of the society and the economy, and contribute to the global response to climate change, China Unicom has successfully implemented a large number of successful technical and management measures with a focus on the construction of sustainable digital information infrastructure.</p>

                                    <p>“The ongoing environmental crisis highlights the importance of reducing our carbon footprint through innovative technologies. The partnership between Intel and China Unicom on data center energy conservation and emissions reduction reflects the commitment of both companies to sustainability and provides a useful industry reference for improving the energy efficiency of servers.

                        <p>At present, China Unicom’s sustainable development strategy has been widely implemented across the data center sector, effectively driving the realization of low-carbon development. China Unicom has partnered with Intel to make full use of Intel Intelligent Energy Management solution to further drive the energy conservation and emissions reduction of data centers. The solution can forecast and optimize energy consumption through software and artificial intelligence (AI) models. This improves the operational energy efficiency of data centers while meeting service-level agreements (SLAs) for business workloads without the need for any software application changes. At present, the solution has been trialed for China Unicom big data and other scenarios. Tests have shown that the solution saves 28% more energy when compared to the baseline configuration that did not use Intel Intelligent Energy Management solution.1 China Unicom and Intel also plan to further expand the application of the solution to more use case/workload scenarios while improving the sustainable development of China Unicom.</p>

                        <h2 class="fw-light mt-5 pt-3">Background: Lowering Data Center Energy Consumption Is the Key to Realizing the Dual Carbon Goals</h2>
                       <p>With the increasing environmental and energy supply crises, more and more people are turning their attention to environmental protection. Reducing energy consumption and establishing a sustainable economy in which man and nature can develop in harmony helps reduce environmental pressure and is a prerequisite for sustainable development. China’s dual carbon action plan outlines that peak carbon and carbon neutrality will be achieved during the “14th Five-Year Plan” and “15th Five-Year Plan” periods, respectively. These goals shall be realized through sustainable energy and low-carbon transformation, energy conservation, carbon reduction, and carbon peaking in the industrial sector and urban and rural construction.</p>
                       <p>Nevertheless, overall energy consumption keeps growing. A research report shows that global energy consumption increased by 5.8% in 2021,2 surpassing pre-pandemic levels as a result of accelerated economic activities. This worsens the challenges facing low-carbon development. The sustainable development of cloud and data centers is the key to realizing energy conservation and emissions reduction across society and the economy as a whole. Data shows that the energy consumption of data centers in China exceeded 200 billion kWh by the end of 2020, accounting for 2.7% of the country’s total energy consumption. It is projected that this figure will reach 270 billion kWh by 2022. <sup>3</sup></p>
                       <p>As a leading global telecommunications operator, China Unicom outlined that it would “continuously improve the sustainability of communications network infrastructure, and help the industry reach a new level of sustainable, low-carbon, and high-quality development” in the “14th Five-Year Action Plan on Carbon Peak and Carbon Neutrality” published in 2021.4 China Unicom seeks to minimize the energy consumption of communication cloud construction, management, and operations while ensuring the efficient development of communication services such as 5G.</p>
                       <p>To reduce the energy consumption of data centers, the industry generally aims to optimize power usage effectiveness (PUE) of data centers and reduce the energy consumption of auxiliary equipment such as air conditioners. The problem is that PUE becomes bottlenecked when reduced to a certain level, while certain solutions aimed at reducing PUE are complex and require large amounts of deployment and construction labor. In addition to extending the construction period, this also results in a significant increase to the total cost of ownership (TCO).</p>
                       <p>In consideration of these factors, China Unicom tried to further promote energy conservation and emissions reduction through data center IT equipment. To realize this transformation, it would be necessary to enhance the precision of CPU energy consumption adjustments and improve the energy efficiency of the core piece of data center IT equipment, the servers themselves. But this strategy also faces a variety of challenges.</p>
                       <ul>
                        <li>Although CPU processes and technologies are constantly improving, the higher demands of data centers workloads for computing power and power density have caused the overall thermal design power (TDP) of CPU chips to continue to rise. This poses a significant challenge to the overall energy consumption of servers.</li>
                        <li>Traditional CPU energy consumption control solutions typically adopt flexible orchestration to realize partial redundant host hibernation, deep energy conservation of idle cores, and regulation of light load cores. These solutions typically adopt a static adjustment strategy, which cannot be flexibly adjusted and configured in accordance with operational demands. The host and kernel are also typically shut down as a whole, making it difficult to realize finer-grained control and resulting in unsatisfactory energy consumption reduction.</li>
                        <li>Traditional CPU energy consumption control solutions cannot precisely gain insights into or project CPU workloads and cannot effectively meet SLAs while accurately controlling energy consumption.</li>
                       </ul>

                        <h2 class="fw-light mt-5 pt-3">Solution: Using Intel Intelligent Energy Management Solution to Realize the Energy Saving and Emissions Reduction of Data Centers</h2>
                        <p>China Unicom and Intel began their partnership in 2021 to further drive the sustainable development of data centers. The partners formulated a comprehensive data center energy conservation and emissions reduction plan. Starting from 5G core networks, they have gradually expanded into sectors such as big data, and continuously driven the implementation of smart energy conservation solutions. The partners are focusing the current stage of their cooperation on the energy conservation and emissions reduction of servers. They have adopted Intel Intelligent Energy Management solution to forecast and control energy consumption in a more accurate and intelligent manner, improving the operational energy efficiency of data centers while meeting service-level agreements (SLAs) for business workloads.</p>

                        <h2 class="fw-light mt-5 pt-3">China Unicom Adopts Intel Intelligent Energy Management Solution to Optimize Data Center Energy Consumption</h2>
                        <p>China Unicom analyzed the operational data and processor usage of 5G network elements, big data, and other services of its communications cloud resource pool. The analysis shows that volume differs with time of day and is characterized by peaks and valleys. During service, the operational status of the server can be adjusted to realize dynamic energy conservation and emissions reduction by detecting changes in service workloads and quality indicators in real time.</p>
                        <p>Supported by the rich components and integrated optimization strategies of Intel Intelligent Energy Management, China Unicom worked to improve energy conservation and emissions reduction from the following aspects:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>During server operation, the components supported by Intel Intelligent Energy Management are used to perform intelligent telemetry on a variety of operating states and provide relevant information for closed-loop control logic.</li>
                            <li>Modeling based on operational data. Intel Intelligent Energy Management APIs can be used to rapidly perform automated feature generation, along with operations such as scaling and filling the gaps in time series data.</li>
                            <li>Realize hyperparameter search, retrieve higher-quality sets of hyperparameters according to the forecast target, optimize the model and data processing, and develop a time series projection model.</li>
                            <li>Use the model to perform inference (or performance evaluation and optimization) on real-time operational data to obtain final processor usage forecasting data.</li>
                            <li>Realize AI control based on projection data to enable C/UFreq that closely follows workload changes, meeting the SLA requirements of business workloads while improving energy conservation.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="pt-3">During the early stage of their partners, China Unicom and Intel tested the 5GC network element application scenarios. The partners are now working on the testing and deployment of solutions for big data services. The workloads of China Unicom’s big data operations show clear fluctuations over time, with large differences between peaks and valleys. Adopting energy conservation measures during valleys is projected to have signiﬁcant effects.</p>
                        <p>Based on the identified characteristics, China Unicom designed an energy conservation prototype based on Intel Intelligent Energy Management. The prototype starts with batch scenarios. Energy conservation is realized through peak and valley load characteristics, defaulting to high-performance configuration during peaks, automatically switching to low-power configuration during valleys, and configuring the CPU cfreq and ufreq as required.</p>
                        <p>Test data shows that Intel Intelligent Energy Management energy conservation solution saves 28.6% more energy than the baseline configuration that did not use Intel Intelligent Energy Management solution.1 This is largely due to the solution’s support for adaptive cfreq scaling. As the baseline configuration remains at high frequencies, Intel Intelligent Energy Management consumes far less power.</p>

                        <p>If extrapolated to the entire cloud resource pool, the solution has the potential to save millions of kWh of electricity every year. When combined with the energy conservation and consumption reduction provided by existing data center PUE solutions, it has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by thousands of tons per year.</p>

                        <h2 class="fw-light mt-5 pt-3">Outlook</h2>
                        <p>The China Unicom’s energy conservation and emissions reduction strategy empowered by Intel Intelligent Energy Management has achieved the expected results. With the goal of realizing energy conservation without modifying hardware, the parties have significantly reduced the energy consumption of 5GC network elements and servers in big data services, all the while meeting the SLA requirements of business workloads. Through the combination of server energy saving and emissions reduction with other energy conservation measures, China Unicom enhances data center sustainability at a larger scale and facilitates the construction of sustainable data centers. Intel has also released the “Intel Technology Framework for Sustainable Data Centers” to jointly drive the green and sustainable development of data centers with customers and the industry chain as a whole.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of their current achievements, China Unicom and Intel plan to further enhance energy conservation by expanding their cooperation in the following aspects:</p>
                        <ul>
