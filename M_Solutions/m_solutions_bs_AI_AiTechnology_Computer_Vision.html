                            Because computer vision applications are diverse, infrastructure needs vary greatly based on
                            the problem you’re trying to solve, where data is trained and analyzed, and the size of the
                            workload. In this section, we share three key questions to consider as you select the best
                            hardware for your use cases.

                        <p class="m_para2">
                            To identify the optimal hardware for your training workload, first consider whether your AI
                            strategy and use case require model training or fine-tuning capabilities at the edge, in the
                            cloud and data center, or both. Cost or security constraints may prevent you from training
                            data in the cloud. Additionally, you may be able to take advantage of off-peak cycles
                            available on your edge servers, allowing you to train where the data is generated.
                        </p>
                        <p class="m_para2">
                            For lightweight training at the edge, such as fine-tuning models, we recommend a
                            server-class Intel® Xeon® Scalable processor with <a href="" class="m_ai_link2">Intel® Data

                            For training or deploying large data sets or if you need to train models quickly at the
                            edge, your workload may require additional infrastructure or cloud-based training and
                            inferencing. We recommend considering a distributed training model by pairing AI workloads
                            with on-premises servers. Using multiple <a href="" class="m_ai_link2">Intel® Xeon® Scalable
                                processors</a> with built-in AI acceleration can unlock efficient and cost-effective

                            Another critical consideration for selecting hardware for your computer vision solution is
                            whether you’re deploying in a traditional IT environment or a location with unique
                            environmental challenges. Demanding environments such as industrial factory floors,

                            If you need to process a large volume of image or video data, it may be too costly to upload

                            to the cloud. You could also be facing latency requirements that prohibit cloud processing.
                            Additionally, you may need your model to continue processing at the edge when the cloud is
                            inaccessible or may need your model to analyze data and react quickly.
