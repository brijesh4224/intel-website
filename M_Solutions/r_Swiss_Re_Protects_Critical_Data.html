                        <p style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">
                            Today, reinsurance enterprises expect big data to generate significant improvements to their
                            marketing, client experience, underwriting, and claims management. Reinsurance enterprises
                            such as Swiss Re that embraces a data analytics approach can use data for more accurate and
                            meaningful insights from the ever-increasing amounts of data being generated from a variety
                            of sources. For Swiss Re, one of the world’s largest reinsurance providers, data is key to
                            understand and reinsure risks to make the world more resilient.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Confidential Computing and Decentriq</h2>
                        <p style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">
                            In today’s data-centered world, data is normally encrypted at rest, in storage and in
                            transit, but there is demand for protection of data in use to ensure that data is protected
                            even while it is being processed. Enterprises and organizations that are working with
                            sensitive data, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial data, or health
                            information, need to mitigate threats that target the confidentiality and integrity of
                            either the application or the data being processed. The sovereignty of customer data should
                            be protected and not subject to attacks from external or internal threats. Although Swiss Re
                            is a reinsurance leader known for leveraging data science and sophisticated machine learning
                            models, gaining access to datasets that contain sensitive information continues to present
                            significant challenges.</p>
                        <p>Confidential Computing, as made available by Decentriq, helps to protect data in use by
                            performing computation in a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). These
                            isolated environments also known as enclaves help to secure data, IP, and code and to
                            prevent unauthorized access or modification of applications and data while they are in use.
                        </p>
                        <p>Confidential computing not only significantly improves the protection of data, it provides
                            paths for companies to extract analytical, actionable insights from this data—while helping
                            to maintain consumer privacy.</p>
                        <p>In a world where we are constantly storing, consuming, and sharing sensitive data—from credit
                            card data to medical records, from firewall configurations to our geolocation
                            data—protecting sensitive data in all its states is more critical than ever. Cryptography is
                            now commonly deployed to provide both data confidentiality (stopping unauthorized viewing)
                            and data integrity (preventing or detecting unauthorized changes). While techniques to
                            protect data in transit and at rest are now commonly deployed, the third state—protecting
                            data in use—is the new frontier called Confidential Computing.</p>
                        <p>Decentriq’s Confidential Computing-based platform is built using <a href="">Intel® Software
                                Guard
                                Extensions (Intel® SGX)</a>. Intel SGX is one of the main technologies powering
                            Confidential
                            Computing today, enabling new cloud use cases such as Multi Party Computation, Privacy
                            Preserving Machine Learning, and many others spread across industries that are dealing with
                            privacy and the cloud on a day-to-day basis. Intel SGX is the most tested, researched, and
                            deployed hardware based Trusted Execution Environment in the data center with the smallest
                            available attack surface within the system.</p>
                        <p>Decentriq’s mission is to solve cloud security and privacy challenges, particularly for
                            organizations collaborating on sensitive data both internally and externally. Decentriq
                            technology allows customers to operate on even the most sensitive and private datasets
                            without having to trust the cloud provider. Decentriq provides deterministic security by
                            encrypting applications and data everywhere—at rest, in motion, and in use with its
                            technology built upon Intel SGX and other Intel security technologies.
                            Decentriq created its platform in 2019, one of the first SaaS solutions to implement
                            confidential computing. Decentriq provides an innovative approach to security and privacy,
                            allowing organizations with sensitive data to operate in the public cloud to exchange and
                            collaborate on data with each other.</p>
                        <p>Intel SGX offers hardware-based memory encryption that isolates specific application code and
                            data in memory. Intel SGX allows user-level code to allocate private regions of memory,
                            called enclaves, which are designed to be protected from processes running at higher
                            privilege levels. Only Intel SGX offers such a granular level of control and protection.</p>
                        <p>Intel SGX can help prevent against attacks such as memory bus snooping, memory tampering and
                            cold boot attacks against memory in RAM. It helps protect against software-based attacks
                            even if the operating system, drivers, BIOS, and Virtual Machine Manager are compromised.
                        </p>
                        <p>This data is no longer a tool that records what has been done, it’s now a tool to fuel future
                            growth. Swiss Re leverages its global footprint, deep understanding of insurance, ever
                            increasing access to data and state of the art data science capabilities to equip their
                            insurance clients across the globe with the right tools to drive actionable data insights.
                            For Swiss Re’s proprietary risk models and tools to become more efficient, they, amongst
                            other things, use machine learning models to have constant access to new data sources.
                            However, one of the challenges that the industry faces is doing analytics on critical data
                            sources, while ensuring the data remains protected. These data sources can be highly
                            relevant for assessing existing or new risks, e.g., in the area of IoT, by making them
                            usable in a protected way, insurability, fair pricing, and efficient claims processes can be
                            enhanced or even enabled.</p>
                        <p>As a data-driven, risk knowledge company with a major focus on machine intelligence, Swiss Re
                            constantly pursues initiatives to test new data driven technologies. Swiss Re recognizes the
                            potential of doing analytics while keeping the data protected, and therefore has launched
                            multiple workstreams to explore new technologies in this field. Among this is Confidential
                            Computing with Decentriq and Intel SGX.</p>
                        <p>Swiss Re’s collaboration with Decentriq is opening the door to Confidential Computing, by
                            helping Swiss Re’s machine learning algorithms.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Swiss Re and Decentriq – Collaborative Application in Marine
                            Insurance Data</h2>
                        <p>Swiss Re needs continuous datasets for marine shipping data from supply chain data aggregator
                            platforms, but data privacy and competitive concerns present barriers in accessing that
                            data. From an insurer’s perspective, marine data is critical because the total value of
                            goods in port at any point in time is calculated only up to a certain point. This presents
                            difficulties for Swiss Re as building calculation models with incomplete data increases the
                            risk of over or underestimation. The goal of the pilot program with Decentriq was to
                            demonstrate the data size scalability and security when processing confidential operations
                            on marine data set by generating larger amounts of data synthetically.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>In Swiss Re’s evaluation of the Confidential Computing solution provided by Decentriq the
                            focus was on several key areas:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Performance</b>– Swiss Re found no performance degradation while using Decentriq’s
                                solution with typical datasets used by Swiss Re. With <a href="">3rd Generation Intel®
                                    Xeon®
                                    Scalable Processors</a>, Swiss Re anticipates even further order of magnitude
                                performance
                                optimization.</li>
                            <li><b>Time to Market</b>– Swiss Re is confident that new use cases can be deployed with
                                Decentriq technology in an expeditious manner thus increasing time to market and with
                                reasonable development and run costs.</li>
                            <li><b>Security</b>– Swiss Re solicited one of its preferred security advisors to run a
                                security audit including penetration testing on the Decentriq solution, which found no
                                significant issues over a 3-day audit.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The successful collaboration has shown that that Confidential Computing with Decentriq and
                            Intel SGX is a technology that can solve issues and is ready for enterprise scale across a
                            variety of use cases.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Closing Remarks</h2>
                        <p>As the insurance industry evolves to an even more data driven service, one can see the
                            concept of Insurance as a Service becoming a commodity seamlessly integrated along with
                            other services. To achieve this, leading re/insurers could continue to build ecosystem
                            partnerships with data providers and suppliers like Decentriq and Intel. Gaining access to
                            sensitive datasets from sources that are trusted will be at the core of this new paradigm,
