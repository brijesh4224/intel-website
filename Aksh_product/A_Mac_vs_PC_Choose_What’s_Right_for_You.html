                                            own a Mac, you’ll likely have to borrow a friend’s PC or download additional
                                            software (which could be prone to more crashes), or else you’ll end up
                                            sitting out altogether. With a severely limited library of Steam games,
                                            recent Mac operating systems can’t support hundreds of games, leaving Mac
