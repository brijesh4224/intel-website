                                        it sounds like: a computer designed to take up less space. As creative builders
                                        and manufacturers continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible with this
                                        form factor, smaller PCs continue to increase in popularity and accessibility.

                                    <p class="V_pv mb-0">The size of these mini gaming PCs offers distinct advantages,
                                        like better portability for your next LAN party and more flexible placement in
                                        spaces that might not work with a traditional desktop tower. For a long time,
                                        though, experimenting with SFF meant sacrificing gaming performance or
                                        functionality to get that smaller footprint. That’s changed over the last few

                                            are some loose guidelines tied to case measurements. When discussing the
                                            internal layout and size of PC cases, volume is often an important
                                            consideration, and is usually measured in liters. A standard-size ATX
                                            desktop tower is usually around 40-45 liters. By comparison, a common
                                            measurement for SFF is around half of that — 25 liters or less.

                                            eliminating cables, and the smaller size fits nicely with the goals of SFF.
                                            Many Mini-ITX motherboards even support multiple M.2 drives, though keep in
