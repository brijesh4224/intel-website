                <p class="mb-2">Intel Corporation believes that forging relationships with security researchers and fostering security research is a crucial part of our Security First Pledge (read more). We encourage security researchers to work with us to mitigate and coordinate the disclosure of potential security vulnerabilities. The Intel® Bug Bounty Program enables external security researchers to earn rewards for providing valuable research to the Intel Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT). This page includes all the details outlining the program that should answer the “What is covered?” “Can I participate?” and “What rewards can I earn?” questions and more. If you have any other questions about this program, please contact us through the PSIRT email box: secure@intel.com.</p>
                <p class="mb-2">Please review these Bug Bounty Program Terms before submitting a report. By submitting your report, you agree to the terms of the Intel® Bug Bounty Program. </p>

                <p>
                    To report a potential security issue or vulnerability with an <b>Intel® branded product or technology</b>, you may submit a report via email to Intel PSIRT (<a class="b_special_a1" href="">secure@intel.com</a>). Please, encrypt all email messages containing information related to potential security vulnerabilities using the Intel PSIRT <a class="b_special_a1" href="">PGP public key</a>. A member of the Intel Product Security Team will review your e-mail and contact you to collaborate on resolving the issue. For more information on how Intel works to resolve security issues, see: <a class="b_special_a1" href="">Vulnerability handling guidelines</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have trouble encrypting your vulnerability report or have any questions about the process, send a message to Intel PSIRT (<a class="b_special_a1" href="">secure@intel.com</a>). We will work with you to identify a method to securely transmit your vulnerability report.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>*Reports submitted through direct contact are not eligible for monetary rewards</b>. During this submission method PSIRT will notify that to be eligible for rewards you must submit through the Bug Bounty Program. You will have 60 days from the day of that notice, or up to the date of disclosure (whichever is shorter) to submit the vulnerability report to the Bug Bounty Program and be considered eligible for monetary rewards. See “Report Eligibility Criteria” for additional details.

Those factors include, but are not limited to, the quality of the report, impact of the potential vulnerability, type of vulnerability, CVSS severity score, whether a POC was provided and the quality of the POC (see “Report Eligibility Criteria”). The table below is a general guide to the potential award amounts. However, the awards may vary based on the factors mentioned.</p>

                <p>
                    Any conduct by a security researcher or reporter that appears to be unlawful, malicious, or criminal in nature will immediately disqualify any submission from the program. Do not engage in extortion. Vulnerabilities in products and technologies that do not meet “<b>Product Eligibility Criteria</b>,” are considered out of Scope.

                    <li>
                        Awards are limited to one (1) bounty award per eligible root-cause vulnerability. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Intel will award a bounty depending on the vulnerability type and originality, quality, and content of the report. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Intel will recognize awarded security researchers via Intel Security Advisories at or after the time of public disclosure of the vulnerability, in coordination with the security researcher who reported the vulnerability

                    <li>
                        Award amounts may change with time. Past rewards do not necessarily guarantee the same reward in the future.

                </ul>
                <p class="mb-1"><b>When will a bounty be awarded? What is the schedule for payment?</b></p>
                <p class="mb-1">Each bug bounty report is individually evaluated based on the technical details provided in the report. Intel follows the processes below to evaluate and determine the severity of a reported potential security vulnerability.</p>
                <ul class="mb-1">
                    <li>
                        Vulnerability Assessment – Intel PSIRT ensures that all requested information has been provided for Triage. See the Bug Bounty Reporting section above for a list of required information. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Triage - A team of Intel product engineers and security experts will determine if a vulnerability is valid, and an eligible Intel product or technology is impacted. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Vulnerability severity determination – Intel PSIRT works with the Intel product security engineers and Intel security experts to determine the severity and impact of a vulnerability.  
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-1"><b>Can I earn rewards for a report if I was not the first to report it?</b></p>
                <p class="mb-1 ms-5">
                    In most cases, no. See “<b>Report Eligibility Criteria</b>” for the policy statement. To earn a reward, you must be the first person to submit the vulnerability information to Intel. If your report has been flagged as a duplicate (non-original) we will do our best to provide information to you about the original submission to indicate when and how it was submitted. This may include a CVE number, Intel Security Advisory number, ticket identifier and/or date of the original submission. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-1"><b>Will I be acknowledged for Open-Source Software vulnerabilities? </b></p>
                <p class="mb-1 ms-5">
                    See the “<b>Intellectual Property</b>” section. Intel will provide acknowledgment to the original researcher/reporter for any Submission which reaches a coordinated disclosure status. This includes only reports  that have been accepted by Intel PSIRT. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-1"><b>I sent a vulnerability in an email (PSIRT Direct Contact) before sending it through the Bug Bounty Program. Can I earn a Bounty for it? </b></p>
                <p class="mb-1 ms-5">
                    In most cases, yes. Rewards can <b>ONLY</b> be offered through the Intel Bug Bounty Program, and <b>NOT</b> through PSIRT Direct Contact. When using the direct contact method, PSIRT will remind you that if you wish to be eligible for a bounty you MUST use the Bug Bounty Program to submit the vulnerability. A time limit will apply to all submissions that request to be transferred. See “<b>Report Eligibility Criteria</b>” for more details.
