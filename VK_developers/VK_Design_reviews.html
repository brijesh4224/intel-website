                                        components on a schematic for designs using Intel silicon. Detailed information
                                        about misconnected or unconnected pins, recommended circuits and component
                                        values,
                                        and voltage nets will be provided. Rules used in schematic reviews are developed
                                        from the Platform Design Guide, the Reference Platform, Intel product
                                        datasheets,
                                        and any relevant Intel-published Whitepapers. Reviews do not provided guidance

                                    and may be accepted or rejected. Each company is ultimately responsible for
                                    determining the suitability of its own design and is responsible for the quality of
