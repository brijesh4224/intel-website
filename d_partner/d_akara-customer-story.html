                        <p>Stevie typically spends his days entertaining in a retirement community. On any given day,
                            he’ll sing, lead a dance group, ask residents about their day, rattle off a painfully corny
                            joke - whatever it takes to lift spirits.</p>
                        <p>Similar to other healthcare workers facing a global pandemic, Stevie had to learn new skills
                            to lend a hand. But unlike his colleagues, he was able to shed his 4-foot 7-inch humanoid
                            appearance and reboot as “Violet,” a prototype of a new robot that combines two superpowers:
                            Using AI to navigate spaces and ultraviolet light to destroy bacteria and complex viral
                            strains.</p>

                            Irish startup that specializes in designing artificially intelligent helpers for the
                            healthcare industry. Akara engineers moved quickly to join in the fight against the
                            coronavirus, teaming up with Intel to spin off the core technology of Stevie with the goal

                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">AI on a New Wavelength</h2>
                        <p>A certain range of ultraviolet light known as UV-C has been clinically proven to kill complex
                            viruses and bacteria and has been used in hospitals for disinfection processes for the last
                            decade.</p>
                        <p>Though there hasn’t been any conclusive research on the effects of UV-C on the SARS-CoV-2
                            virus that can cause the COVID-19 illness yet, studies have shown that it can be used
                            against other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1.1 The UV-C radiation warps the structure of a
                            virus’s or bacteria’s genetic material and prevents the viral particles from reproducing.
                            Early findings from studying UV-C’s effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 at Columbia
                            University’s Center for Disease and Immunity have been promising.</p>

                        <p>UV-C robots have been used to sterilize hospitals, but most aren’t designed to work with
                            humans in the room. Their bulky size makes it difficult to navigate crowded spaces and reach
                            shadowy areas. They blast light that can be dangerous to humans in large doses, requiring
                            rooms to be vacated for the safety of healthcare workers or patients since exposure to the
                            light can be harmful, causing sunburn, eye damage, and even skin cancer.</p>
                        <p>In order to detect and avoid humans in the room, the Violet prototype is designed to use
                            motion sensors, an <a href="">Intel® Movidius™ Vision Processing Unit</a> and a Luxonis
                            DepthAI platform for AI, depth, and feature tracking. This allows the slim and nimble Violet
                            to work around the people in the room, navigate to shadowy corners, clean surfaces, and
                            automatically switch off before anyone enters her limited field of ultraviolet rays.</p>
                        <p>Stevie needed computer vision to navigate a room and face a person talking to him, critical
                            skills in order to be socially interactive and appear engaged. The Akara team joined an
                            Intel-funded incubator in January 2020, where Movidius and Luxonis worked with them to build
                            out advanced perceptual faculties for Stevie.</p>
                        <p>When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the whole team sought a way to help. Following discussions at
                            the incubator, Akara’s engineers sprinted to assemble a Violet prototype in only 24 hours.
                            They adapted Stevie’s computer vision capabilities to ensure Violet could steer clear of
                            human interaction.</p>
                        <p>“In some ways, Violet’s ‘person-detector’ has been easier to activate,” said Jonathan Byrne,
                            a senior software developer at Movidius, which has been working closely with Akara on the
                            robot. “Stevie needed to do 10-15 things, while Violet needs to do much less: clean and
                            avoid people.”</p>

                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Cutting Cleaning Time Without Cutting Corners</h2>
                        <p>Violet doesn’t represent the first attempt to replace traditional, manual disinfection
                            techniques.</p>
                        <p>Some hospitals today use other “no touch” approaches with chemical-based disinfectants, which
                            are effective but require evacuating rooms for much of the day.3 For example, hydrogen
                            peroxide vapor can take more than five hours to fully disinfect a room before people can
                            safely return to work in the area. And it simply can’t be applied in some hospital rooms.
                        </p>
                        <p>Health systems around the world are already seeing long waiting lists for medical imagery and
                            the slowdown only exacerbates cost pressure on hospitals. For example, radiology presents
                            unique challenges: in many cases, high-tech equipment like CT scanners can’t be treated with
                            deep chemicals and must be cleaned by hand, a process often done by the radiographers that
                            takes up to 1.5 hours for every 15 minute procedure.</p>
                        <p>Expecting to be ready for hospitals by mid-2020, Violet was recently tested disinfecting CT
                            scanners and isolation rooms in Ireland in order to reduce long downtimes due to the
                            disinfection process. Akara found that the robot could speed things along and spare
                            healthcare workers a potentially dangerous task of manually disinfecting rooms.</p>
                        <p>Violet’s compact size and ability to operate safely amongst people makes it suitable for
                            tasks outside the hospital as well. The prototype is currently being tested for Dublin’s
                            public transit system, and it’s also shown potential for disinfecting other high foot
                            traffic, hard-to-clean spaces such as bathrooms, airports, hotels, cruise ships and waiting
                            rooms.</p>
                        <p>“For the COVID-19 outbreak, we’re still in firefighting mode. What we’re focusing on is
                            hospitals and nursing homes, where people are coming in and out every day,” said Niamh
                            Donnelly, Akara co-founder and director of AI and machine learning.</p>
                        <p>But she acknowledges Violet may soon be needed elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>“As people are going back to work, holidays, and trying to resume their lives, the areas
                            where Violet will be needed will change. We get more than 10-20 emails a day from different
                            industries asking about a robot like Violet.”</p>

                        <p>In a world that is more vulnerable to pandemics, academics are looking to robots like Violet
                            as playing an essential role in ensuring population safety.5 Future use cases are already
                            clear: Robots like Stevie and Violet could be further adapted to use computer vision to
                            monitor social distancing, ensure compliance with personal protective equipment (PPE) rules,
                            and even perform contact tracing. These capabilities are currently being explored with open

                            required in the meantime. This experience has taught us the urgency of making every hospital
                            pandemic-ready, for the sake of both patients and frontline workers. We need all the help we
