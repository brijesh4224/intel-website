                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Recognize the Need for Private 5G Networks</h3>
                        <p>Private networks refer to privately owned wireless connectivity solutions—typically built on 5G virtualized radio access network (vRAN) infrastructure—that support AI, data generation, processing, analysis, and communications at the edge. Private networks use cellular technologies to deliver more throughput, reliability, and coverage than Wi-Fi and are meant to augment but not replace traditional Wi-Fi.<br>
                            Two primary criteria that indicate the need for a private network include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                <p><strong>Scalability and flexibility</strong>, specifically when an organization needs to onboard hundreds or thousands of users and devices. Consider a stadium environment with thousands of spectators or a mix of edge devices, including live event broadcasting inside the stadium and AI computer vision‒enabled traffic management outside the stadium.<br>

                                </li>
                                <li>
                                <p><strong>Challenging environments</strong> such as the outdoors, a warehouse or factory floor, or anywhere where a wired connection would be inconvenient, impractical, and excessively expensive. Consider the need to connect automated farming equipment in a rural area or equipment and personnel on an oil rig in the middle of the ocean.<br>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Businesses and organizations in entertainment and venue management, utilities, the energy sector, industrial factories or warehouses, airports, seaports, and other transportation and logistics hubs can all benefit from private networks for their connectivity needs now and in the future.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Understand the Benefits of Private 5G Networks</h3>
                        <p>Private 5G networks do not negate or replace existing Wi-Fi or radio capabilities, nor will all private networking solutions be exclusively private. Rather, deploying private 5G networks most often becomes a hybrid implementation that provides additive business benefits to existing capabilities, helping to make brownfield and greenfield environments completely wireless.</p>
                        <p class="my-0">Additive benefits of private 5G networks include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Coverage</strong> that’s tailored to the environment. In addition to being especially useful for outdoor conditions, private networking offers the ability to place vRAN nodes across a site to deliver coverage and capacity suited to an organization’s exact needs. Read how Intel, Verizon, and Nokia <a href="#" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline">helped bring private 5G connectivity to 726 acres in one of Britain’s busiest seaports</a>.</li>
                            <li><strong>Control</strong> with enhanced security for sensitive data and workloads, including the ability to customize policies on how that data is stored, transmitted, and used. Organizations also benefit from data sovereignty and the assurance that comes with maintaining data on wholly owned infrastructure instead of using slices of a public cellular operator. Read how Intel ecosystem partner Comba <a href="#" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline">deployed a private 5G network with hardened enclosures and reliability features for a mining company</a>.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cost reductions</strong> through efficient infrastructure that enables low operating expenditures (OpEx) and supports cost-efficient data processing at the edge instead of having to backhaul workloads to the cloud. Many organizations can use existing infrastructure—including rack servers, switches, and routers—to help jump-start their private network deployments for an easier, more cost-efficient path to value. Watch as Intel, AWS, and Megh Computing<a href="#"  style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"> enable a private 5G network to quickly provide broadband internet access to underserved school districts during COVID-19</a>.</li>
                            <li><strong>Competitive advantage</strong> built on the enhanced productivity and flexibility of digital transformation and edge AI use cases. Private 5G networks are also built on a foundation of cellular technologies that have been proven and tested over years, so organizations have a reliable means to plan for success. Read how Intel and Mavenir <a href="#"  style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline">use the performance and reliability of private 5G networks to enable edge AI and Industry 4.0 outcomes</a>.</li>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Plan Your Private 5G Network Implementation</h3>
                        <p>When planning your private 5G network deployment, the first consideration is to establish your organization’s coverage, capacity, speed, and latency needs. For example, how much throughput is required to support a live UHD video broadcast? How time sensitive are workloads for robotics use cases? You will work with your solution provider to determine the technical specifications required.</p>
                        <p>The second major consideration is understanding your backhauling needs, or how much of your data generated and processed at the edge will stay at the edge. Some data may need to be backhauled to the 5G core network, an enterprise IT network, or the cloud for additional processing. One of the key advantages of private 5G networks is the ability to analyze and act on data at the edge, reducing the costs involved with backhauling data, although this will depend on each use case.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, working with your solution provider, you will need to explore the availability of the 5G spectrum in your region. This is determined at the national government level and differs for each country.</p>
                        <p>Read this white paper to explore a <a href="#" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline">detailed implementation workflow for AI-ready enterprise private 5G networks</a>.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Reduce Complexity with a Trusted Technology Partner</h3>
                        <p>Private network deployments are one element of a full end-to-end solution that includes edge compute capabilities. Working with a technology partner can help manage the complexity of these distributed environments while streamlining costs and solution orchestration hurdles.</p>
