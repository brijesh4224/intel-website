                            demand to reduce healthcare costs, and improved computing power in reduced-cost hardware.
                            There is also a rising trend in using innovative solutions to achieve a better balance

                        <h2>Challenge: Complexity in Contouring for Radiation Therapy (RT) Planning</h2>
                        <p>RT planning is a complex process that relies on advanced imaging technology.<sup>4</sup> The
                            process usually begins with image simulation, in which practitioners use three-dimensional
                            (3D) computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or a combination thereof,
                            to visualize patient anatomy. Then a radiologist—or a radiation oncologist in the case of a
                            cancer diagnosis—contours the relevant target or tumor volumes, compares them to normal
                            tissue volumes, and communicates the goals for RT planning. The treatment plan identifies
                            where the therapeutic dosage of radiation will be used while avoiding nearby, normal
                            tissues.<br>
                            <br>
                            Contouring organs at risk (OARs) is an essential step in which RT professionals manually
                            contour tens of organs on a CT dataset or other modality. This process is monotonous and
                            time consuming, and the resulting contours can often lack consistency because they differ
                            from specialist to specialist.<br>
                            <br>
                            AI-based automated contouring solutions help boost the efficiency and consistency of RT
                            while freeing up professionals to focus on other important tasks. The solutions use
                            convolutional deep neural networks with millions of parameters that are extremely complex
                            and compute intensive. To deliver fast results and responsive interactivity, the underlying
                            architecture powering these solutions needs to provide purpose-built AI acceleration.

                        <p>The benefits of AI acceleration starting at the chip level While the Siemens Healthineers supercomputer is powered by 100 percent renewable energy, the hardware/software acceleration in the latest processor helps boost performance without increasing power requirements, allowing Siemens Healthineers to further reduce system cost, complexity, and energy consumption. Medical solutions also require lengthy periods of development and certification prior to deployment. Select SKUs of 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors deliver long-life availability, which extends the life span of solutions with years of uninterrupted infrastructure supply to support continuous research and innovation.</p>
