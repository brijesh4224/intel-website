                        <p>Having a high-quality internet connection is important when it comes to modern PC gaming.</p>
                        <p>As physical media becomes less common and digital distribution becomes more popular, access
                            to the internet is critical to playing even single-player titles.</p>
                        <p>Modern cyberattacks continue to evade software-only security methods. Combating these threats
                            requires a more comprehensive defense that secures devices at the application, software,
                            firmware, and hardware levels.</p>
                        <p>Choosing the right type of internet connection for your gaming PC shouldn’t be an
                            afterthought. To get the most out of your network, it’s important to understand the basics
                            of how networking technologies work and how they can impact your gaming experience.</p>

                        <p>To communicate with the internet, a device (such as your PC) needs to connect to a modem,
                            often through a separate router. The modem converts the signal from your Internet Service
                            Provider (ISP) and modifies it so it can be used in your home.</p>
                        <p>A router then communicates with the modem and creates the actual network to which your
                            devices connect. The modem and router are often in a single device, usually provided by your
                            ISP when you set up your service.</p>
                        <p>When this local network is in place, your PC can connect to the internet, and you can start
                            gaming online.</p>
                        <p>The fundamentals are simple enough, but every step in that process is worth exploring in more
                            depth.</p>

                        <h4>Bandwidth & Network Speed</h4>
                        <p>There are four primary links in the network chain, and all four should be considered when
                            building out your network.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>ISP</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Modem</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Router</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Network Connection (wired or wireless)</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Let’s start with the external gateway to the internet, the ISP.</p>
                        <p>Your ISP options might be limited depending on where you are, but most ISPs have a variety of
                            tiers of service at different price points. It’s worth comparing the services available in
                            your area to find the ISP with the best reputation, as well as the service that best aligns
                            with your needs.</p>
                        <p>In order to find the right internet service, you’ll want to know the basics of what to look
                            for. These are the metrics you should be considering when making that choice.</p>
                        <p><strong>Bandwidth</strong> refers to the amount of data sent through your internet
                            connection, and is measured as a number of megabits per second (for example, 100 Mbps.) This
                            is the amount of data the connection allows, but it’s a different metric than the speed of
                            that connection.</p>
                        <p><strong>Speed</strong> is separated into two measurements; how quickly data can be downloaded
                            and uploaded.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Download speed</strong> is also measured in megabits per second (Mbps) or
                                gigabits per second (Gbps) for significantly faster connections. Download speed refers
                                to how quickly data is pulled from the internet to a device (think watching a movie from
                                a streaming service).</li>
                            <li><strong>Upload speed</strong> is how quickly data can be pushed out from your device to
                                the internet (think streaming gameplay from your PC to the internet) and is also
                                measured in Mbps and Gbps.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>To simplify, bandwidth is how much data can be transferred over your connection, while speed
                            is how quickly that data can be transferred.</p>
                        <p>Many ISPs offer residential internet services via cable or DSL, and often these connections
                            prioritize download speeds over upload speeds. Other connections such as fiber optic
                            internet allow for symmetrical bandwidth, where download and upload speeds are equal.</p>
                        <p>All other factors aside, the higher the download and upload speeds you have access to, the
                            better. You can check your internet speed by <a href="#" class="b_special_a1">using tools

                        <img src="../img/brijesh/image418.jpg" class="w-100">
                    </div>
                    <div class="b_special_text py-5">
                        <p>While bandwidth and speed are important in day-to-day internet use, latency is arguably the
                            most important networking factor when gaming.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Latency</b> refers to the amount of time it takes for data to make the round-trip
                                from your PC, through your network and to its goal, and then back to your PC. Low
                                latency is important when it comes to gaming, as quickly sending and receiving
                                information to and from a game’s server will result in a better connection, and fewer
                                issues such as lag. One of the simplest ways to reduce latency when gaming is to select
                                the in-game server that’s closest to you, as the data will have less distance to travel.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Ping</b> is how latency is measured, usually in milliseconds (for example, 90.0 ms.)
                                The lower the ping, the lower the latency. Lower ping is better; less than 100ms is
                                ideal. You can measure your ping with services like this one.</li>
                            <li><b>Lag&nbsp;</b>is the result of high latency, and can be one of the most challenging
                                issues when gaming online. If a player is sending or receiving information to a game
                                server slower than another player in the same match, it can result in game-breaking
                                connection issues such as input delay or connection errors. Lag can be a crippling
                                hindrance in a fast-paced competitive game, and should be avoided whenever possible.

                        <h4>Choosing a Router</h4>
                        <p>Choosing the right router can impact on your gaming experience, whether you choose a wired or
                            wireless network.</p>
                        <p>Some examples of features you should consider are:</p>

                            <li><b>Quality of service </b>tools allow a router to prioritize specific traffic, such as
                                traffic normally associated with gaming, over other types of traffic. This can help

                            each iteration allowing for more data, and faster transmission.</p>
                        <p>Category 5 Ethernet cables (often shortened to Cat 5, or Cat 5e for the faster version) and
                            Cat 6 cables are the most common consumer cables currently on the market. There are faster

                            expensive. Cat 7 and 8 are pushing the boundaries of what Ethernet is capable of, but these
                            categories are mostly used for enterprise-level networks due to cost and practical concerns.

                        <p><strong>The right interface on your PC</strong>. Make sure your system is equipped to handle
                            an Ethernet connection and that it’s capable of utilizing your network speeds. Most desktops
                            incorporate an Ethernet controller in the motherboard I/O, but some laptops don’t make this
                            connection available due to form-factor considerations. If this is the case, it’s possible
                            to use a USB to RJ-45 adapter to still experience the benefits of a wired connection. This
                            can result in lower connection speeds depending on the type of USB adapter you use however.

                        <p>We’ve touched on how a network can impact the gaming experience, but let’s get more specific.</p>
                        <p><strong>Bandwidth and Connection Speed</strong></p>
                        <p>Playing games online uses a relatively small amount of data when compared to other activities like streaming video, but having a fast internet speed with a high bandwidth is always a plus, and will likely make your experience online all around better.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Bandwidth</strong> is an important consideration if you have multiple people using one network. Too many devices using data at once can slow things down if bandwidth is limited.</li>
                            <li><strong>Download speed</strong> will impact the speed at which you can download games, as well as updates like patches and post-release content. As games continue to increase in size, this will only become more important.</li>
                            <li><strong>Upload speed </strong>will impact how quickly you can upload files, and can impact the quality of your stream if you choose to livestream gameplay.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Latency and Stability</strong></p>
                        <p>Having low latency and low ping should be one of the most important priorities for a solid gaming network as it has a direct impact on your experience. This is especially true in games where accuracy and responsiveness are critical to success, such as fighting games or competitive first-person shooters.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>

                        <p>Choosing the right server is an important part of reducing lag. A game’s server is what connects you to other players, and acts as an information hub that allows everyone to have a shared experience, whether cooperative or competitive.</p>
                        <p>One of the best ways to reduce latency is to consider distance when choosing a server to play on. Most online games allow you to select a server based on location; it’s recommended to choose the one closest to you. The further data has to travel, the longer the trip will take, and the higher the ping.</p>
                        <p>There are also steps you can take with your local network to help reduce latency, including disabling competing traffic. Disable other devices that are using your connection, and check background processes on your PC to ensure they aren’t using data as well.</p>
                        <p>The fewer devices utilizing your network while gaming, the more resources can be dedicated to your connection, and the lower your latency.</p>
                        <p>Router configuration can also impact latency. While the specifics of your networking hardware are likely unique, researching other player’s experience with your router might provide insight into software or router settings that can help reduce ping.</p>
