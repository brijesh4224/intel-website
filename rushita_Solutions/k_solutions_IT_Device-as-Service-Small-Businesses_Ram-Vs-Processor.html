                                When choosing the best PCs for small business, look for a good balance between processor speed and the amount of RAM. Business-class devices on the Intel vPro® platform can provide greater confidence over consumer devices because they have built-in hardware security that will protect your data and your ideas more than software alone. These choices, combined with the amount of RAM can help you meet today’s challenges and capture tomorrow’s opportunities.

                        <p>Decades of computer shopping have led many people to believe that more RAM is the ultimate solution for improving PC performance. While it’s undoubtedly important, it’s not the only solution for better performance, or even necessarily the right one, depending on your needs.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup></p>
                        <p>An older computer (one that’s more than five years old) takes extra time to boot up, load web pages, and run programs, which can have a surprising impact on your bottom line in lost employee productivity. In one Intel study researchers found that slower computers decrease employee productivity by as much as 29%, potentially costing an employer up to $17,000 in lost productivity for each older computer in the workplace.<sup>3</sup> This same study also estimated that waiting for an older PC to start up each morning can waste up to 11 hours a year.<sup>4</sup></p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Beyond lost productivity, a slower computer leads to frustrated employees, making your hardware investment as much of an employee retention issue as a technology issue. Therefore, it’s often a smart investment to ensure powerful components so your <a href="../rushita_Solutions/k_solutions_IT_Device-as-Service_IT-Management-Small-Businesses.html">small business computers</a> can process more data, run more data-intensive programs, and keep more browser tabs open.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 pt-4 fw-light" id="key1">What RAM Does…and Doesn’t…Do</h3>
                        <p>RAM, stands for Random Access Memory, and is used as a short-term memory for computers to place its data for easy access. The more RAM a computer has, the more data it can usually juggle at any given moment. Think of RAM as a workspace: A giant workbench is obviously easier to work at than a tiny tea tray would be.</p>
                        <p>While more RAM can be good, there are limits to the benefit of adding more RAM. One such limit&nbsp;is a physical aspect: your motherboard can only hold a certain amount of RAM, so if you’re upgrading an older machine that already is nearing maximum RAM capacity, you might not have much room to grow. Another such limit is processing power. All the short-term memory in the world won’t make your employees’ work lives easier if you don’t have the processing power to take advantage of it.</p>
                        <h3 class="mt-5 pt-4 fw-light" id="key2">The Power of the Processor</h3>
                        <p>The processor, also known as the CPU, provides the instructions and processing power the computer needs to do its work. The more powerful and updated your processor, the faster your computer can complete its tasks.</p>
                        <p>By getting a more powerful processor, you can help your computer think and work faster. This alone may be enough to optimize the power of the RAM you already have and help you maximize your investment in any new RAM you do add. If more RAM is like a bigger workbench, then a faster processor is similar to inviting a friend over to help you with your work.</p>

Survey respondents estimated that for PCs more than 5 years old, employees would be up to 29% less productive—based on an average assumed employee’s salary of US$60,000, the lost productivity cost will amount to US$17,000.

                    <div class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1"><sup>4</sup>Employees spend up to 11 hours per year just waiting for their computer to boot up” is based on a 2018 web-based survey, commissioned by Intel and conducted by J. Gold Associates, LLC., of 3,297 respondents from small business in 16 countries (Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, UAE, UK, USA) to assess the challenges and costs associated with deploying older PCs. Assuming one start-up per day and using an average start-up time that was calculated by taking the midpoint of the time that survey respondents estimated it takes to start up a PC that is more than 5 years old, employees were estimated to spend up to 11 hours a year starting up a 5-year-old PC (4.07 minutes X 5 days per week X 52 weeks per year divided by 60 (to get to hours) X utilization rate of .67 so 4.07 X 5 X 52 / 60 X .67 = 11.8).
