                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5">Emergence of the AI PC</h3>
                        <p>Taking a holistic approach to performance, Intel® Core™ Ultra processors feature three compute engines that tackle emerging AI workloads such as content creation and complex data visualization. AI-powered features like smart framing and noise suppression enable advanced collaboration, while AI workflows enable better productivity, battery life, and security for everyday office usage. <sup>1</sup></p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5">Powering a Hybrid Workforce</h3>
                        <p>The hybrid work model, now a common preference and strategic workforce policy to attract and retain talent, has transformed how work gets done and the requirements for supporting employee productivity needs.</p>
                        <p>For IT, enabling a successful, efficient, distributed workforce necessitates business technology that delivers a user experience built to meet real-world needs.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reliable and fast connectivity from anywhere.</li>
                            <li>Professional-grade performance to support multitasking, content creation, video streaming, and virtual collaboration.</li>
                            <li>The ability to secure devices and protect users in various environments from ever-evolving cyber threats.</li>
                            <li>The ability to remotely maintain a fleet of devices efficiently without negatively impacting PC performance.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Older technology that wasn’t built for today’s use cases or to scale for tomorrow’s needs may not adequately handle these requirements or the requirements of newer systems. This is top of mind for IT professionals supporting businesses of all sizes.</p>
                        <p>In a 2022 Forrester survey of industry decision-makers, 69 percent of ITDM respondents indicated that enabling hybrid work for their employees is a top priority; however, 61 percent of ITDMs reported that their ability to support hybrid work was inhibited by poorly performing PCs, and 58 percent anticipated a struggle to support future hybrid work with the PCs they have.<sup>2</sup></p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5">Business PCs for Enhanced Productivity</h3>
                        <p>Setting your employees up for success with business technology designed for how they work helps to drive productivity and contributes to employee satisfaction overall. Mature organizations are 20 percent more likely to experience improved employee retention as a benefit of investing in high-performance, stable PCs.<sup>3</sup></p>
                        <p>There are several key factors regarding business PCs and the demands of today’s dynamic workplaces.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Professional-Grade Performance:</strong> PCs built for business should provide sufficient performance capacity to reduce interruptions and support a better end-user experience. Devices need to adequately address not just the data-intensive workload and workflow needs of business users but also provide additional compute headroom to support IT security, manageability, and telemetry tasks without impacting productivity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Business devices should be equipped to deliver reliable and fast connectivity in various environments to maximize employee productivity and customer and coworker interactions at the pace that business demands.</li>
                            <li><strong>Form Factor: </strong>Employees need devices that deliver performance in a form factor that supports their work. A mobile employee may need a lightweight, durable laptop with long battery life and Wi-Fi connectivity. In contrast, an engineer or creator may need a workhorse desktop or robust workstation to handle their compute-intensive workloads and applications.</li>
                            <li class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1"><strong>Security:</strong> Enterprise cyber threats are becoming more advanced, especially because of the nature of a distributed workforce working beyond a firewall, and a comprehensive endpoint security solution may be required where software-based security alone is insufficient. Business PCs that offer <a href="">hardware-based security</a>&nbsp;alongside software-based security can help limit the impact of attacks and protect data and computing infrastructure. Additionally,<strong> </strong>hardware-based security capabilities are now becoming a system requirement. For example, Windows 11 requires TPM 2.0 capabilities and a certain level of CPU performance, which older systems cannot support.</li>
                            <li><strong>PC Fleet Management Tools</strong>: Efficiently and effectively supporting today’s distributed workforce presents added challenges for IT teams who must remotely manage and maintain a fleet of devices. To better support employees and the companies they work for, minimize downtime, and reduce support tickets, IT needs business PCs built on a reliable and stable platform and a complete suite of remote management tools that can enable proactive maintenance and troubleshooting, even on devices outside the corporate firewall or with nonresponsive operating systems.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="mt-5">The Perfect Opportunity for a Refresh</h3>
                        <p>The modern business environment has been dramatically transformed, and the impact of new use cases on older devices will be substantial. What has occurred is not just digital transformation but an entirely new way of working that performant technologies must support.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, computing technology continues to evolve, and future technology will consider the need for collaborative productivity and complex workloads in their designs to ensure performance.</p>
                        <p>As a result, older PCs will simply be unable to keep up with the technologies that power productivity going forward. Investments made to modernize business PC fleets will contribute positively to the bottom line by providing employees with the performance they need today and tomorrow for optimal productivity and providing IT teams with the tools they need to keep the business running.</p>

                <div class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1"><sup>7</sup>WPA3 Wi-Fi security features: The Wi-Fi Alliance industry consortium will certify Wi-Fi 6 products for compliance with the IEEE 802.11ax standard and will require WPA3 security certification as a prerequisite to ensure the latest in Wi-Fi security features. WPA3 simplified passwords: WPA3 uses Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) to replace the pre-shared key (PSK) exchange protocol used by WPA2. SAE more securely handles initial key exchange and uses forward secrecy, which makes it more resistant to offline decryption attacks and provides stronger password-based authentication. WPA3 enhanced protection: Additional network protection comes from the equivalent of 192-bit cryptographic strength across an 802.11ax network and is superior to the 128-bit AES encryption used with WPA2.
