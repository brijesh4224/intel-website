                            Recommendation systems or recommender systems are AI workflows that suggest products, content, or services to end users. The most common type of AI recommender systems are content recommenders used by streaming and e-commerce platforms.

                            These systems use a combination of technologies such as collaborative filtering to estimate a specific end user’s affinity for a movie or television series they might want to watch or a new product they might want to buy. Recommender systems keep end users engaged with the platform so they continue subscribing, buying products, or viewing ads while they consume content.

                            The effectiveness of recommendation systems depends largely on three factors: accuracy, responsiveness, and cost.

Recommenders can improve their accuracy by integrating a feedback mechanism, such as a simple thumbs up or thumbs down, that allows end users to indicate whether a recommendation is good or bad, reinforcing the AI’s learning.
                            </li>

Personalized banking is an example of an emerging use case in which banks recommend new types of accounts, investments, and other services to grow their customer bases.

                            Following data preparation, AI recommender systems are implemented in two stages: model training and deployment inference—with many steps included therein. Architecture requirements are different between stages. Model training is faster with more parallelization, but optimizing models is less computationally demanding. Once deployed, recommender inference runs efficiently on high-core-count, high-memory-capacity CPUs that are built to manage large models and massive data.
