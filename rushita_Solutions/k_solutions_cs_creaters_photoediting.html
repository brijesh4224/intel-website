                    <div class="my-4">
                        <p>Skilled photographers and professional graphic designers know that only part of their work is
                            completed when a picture is taken – creating compelling images inevitably requires at least
                            some time at a computer with photo-editing software. Hardly anyone, including amateur
                            shutterbugs using their smartphones, presents their images to the world completely
                            unadorned. But it’s really in the hands of upper-echelon creative professionals that editing
                            software sings. Imperfections that strip images of their power and reality can be corrected.
                            Unique elements can be added that provide otherworldly qualities that change the way people
                            react to an image of a person, place or thing.</p>
                        <p class="my-3">No matter what your goals, the most advanced photo-editing software can only
                            attain its full creative potential when teamed with the appropriate hardware. There is a
                            plethora of editing software available, and you must weigh a number of considerations in
                            selecting among many good options. In the same way, hardware choices have expanded
                            dramatically, requiring photographers and graphic artists to consider functionality and
                            desired effects when choosing the device they’ll edit upon.

                        <h2 class="fs-4 my-3">Desktops Edge Over Laptops Disappear</h2>
                        <p class="mb-2">
                            Even people who have been using photo editing software for a relatively short time probably
                            remember a time when desktop computers were the only option for serious craftspeople. Today,
                            however, new laptop models boast speed and storage that rival high-end desktops, suiting
                            those whose editing work must be done in the field, at multiple locations, or taken to
                            clients or colleagues.
                        </p>
                        <p>Built-in high-resolution screens up to Ultra HD 4K provide stunning color, contrast and,
                            detail that discerning photo editors require. In short, modern laptops have all the
                            advantages of heavy-duty desktop photo editing in a lightweight package weighing only 3-4
                            pounds.</p>
                        <h2 class="fs-4 my-3">Laptops Provide More Capabilities Than Tablets</h2>
                        <p class=" mb-2">
                            As desktop computers become less common, laptops can seem a no-brainer choice for <a
                                href="#" class="k_plink">graphic artists</a> and photographers. It’s a different case
                            when considering tablets. While the line between high-end tablets and laptops is blurring,
                            there are several important considerations to keep in mind when image-quality and impact is
                            paramount.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-2">
                            For starters, laptops are larger, with more technology capabilities that can make tablets
                            feel limited and cumbersome. Laptops provide full-sized keyboards, the ability to connect
                            external hard drives and disc burners, and bigger screens with more room for the editing
                            software’s control bars and menus.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Even the highest-quality tablets provide a smaller toolbox of photo editing functions. For
                            example, most mobile devices are limited to review and light editing of JPEG or PNG files.
                            While that is adequate for people who simply want a record of their vacation, upper-echelon
                            creatives will routinely prefer to work with high-resolution RAW files, which allow them to
                            fine-tune detailed images. A more demanding level of image wizardry requires a laptop
                            capable of a full-powered photo editing software, which permits the photographer or graphic
                            artist to explore every creative avenue.

                        <h2 class="fs-4 my-3">Screen: Size Matters (and So Does Resolution)</h2>
                        <p>Recommendation: Integrated chip graphics for casual users, special graphics chips with 60 FPS
                            (frames for second) for power users.</p>
                        <p>Graphics processors offload work from the main CPUs, providing faster processing and better
                            quality display, while also allowing you to move objects around the editing workspace
                            faster.</p>
                        <p>A card from a respected maker like NVIDIA or ATI adds $60 to $200 to the price of a system.
                            Popular models include the basic NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950M, the mid-range GTX 960M, the
                            GT840M, and the high end GTX 980M.</p>
                        <h2 class="fs-4 my-3">Memory: Check Your Gigs</h2>
                        <p class="mb-2">Recommendation: 8 GB for average recreational use, 16 GB for power users.</p>
                        <p>Creatives require sufficient memory to run powerful programs at an adequate speed. RAM, or
                            random access memory, enables photo files to run quickly and multiple instructions to run at
                            once without lagging. While recreational users can get by with 8GB, professional graphic
                            artists and skilled photographers typically need at least 16GB to head off crashes, freezes,
                            and unexpected shutdowns.</p>
                        <h2 class="fs-4 my-3">Storage: Eliminate Bottlenecks</h2>
                        <p class="mb-2">Recommendation: 1 TB hard disk drive, 7200 RPM, 512 GB Solid State Drive (SSD),
                            hybrid with least 128 GB SSD.</p>
                        <p class="mb-2">An insufficient amount of storage creates an I/O bottleneck that slows down
                            processing, editing, and image uploads. At the same time, storage is needed to handle
                            thousands of high-res images. RAW files from a single wedding can easily take up 10GB</p>
                        <p>A Hard Disk Drive (HDD), one type of storage, is a conventional spinning disk. A 1TB hard
                            drive can comfortably support any operating system, leaving at least 700GB for other
                            programs and data. A Solid-State Drive (SSD), another type of storage, is built using chips.
                            SSDs let memory-intensive apps load and run much faster, with blazing read speeds of about
                            1400 MB/s and write speeds of 280+ MB/s.</p>
                        <h2 class="fs-4 my-3">Ports and Connectivity: Don’t Shortchange Yourself</h2>
                        <p class="mb-2">Recommendation: SD card and slot, at least three USB 3.0 or 3.1 ports,
                            Thunderbolt™ on Macs, choice of DisplayPort, HDMI, or VGA output.</p>
                        <p>The rule of thumb is to get as many inputs and outputs as possible. It will permit you to
                            much more easily move photos into your laptop, store them in external storage drives, and
                            burn them to CDs or DVDs. A wealth of ports will also let you easily add large external
                            monitors, a tablet and stylus, and ergonomic keyboards and mice, which can make long editing
                            sessions more comfortable.</p>
                        <h2 class="fs-4 my-3">Choose Your Performance Level</h2>
                        <p>Start your search for the perfect photo editing laptop.
