                        <p>Like many IT organizations, Intel IT is continuously challenged with making the business more
                            efficient. This is critical in Intel's complex supply chain where real-time analytics
                            underpin rapid data-driven decisions. For this reason, Intel IT recently carried out a proof
                            of concept (PoC) exploring the benefits of moving from a scale-out to a scale-up system to
                            speed time to insight.</p>
                        <h5>Challenge</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Improve the agility and efficiency of Intel’s supply chain by enabling faster
                                decision-making based on real-time data analytics</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Solution</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A PoC was run to test the hypothesis that moving from a scale-out to a scale-up solution
                                using <a href=""> Intel® Optane™ DC persistent memory</a> would improve analytics
                                performance</li>
                            <li>Intel IT’s SAP HANA* business analyst compared performance of Intel’s current SAP HANA 2
                                finance analytics cluster comprised of three four-year-old servers versus a single
                                server based on <a href="">2nd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors</a> and Intel Optane
                                DC persistent
                                memory. For this, they used an IT-developed automated test, comprised of 50 queries</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Results</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The PoC showed that one scale-up server with 2nd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors and
                                Intel Optane DC persistent memory delivered an average 2.4X1 faster time to insights
                                than a four-year-old three-server system</li>
                            <li>In addition, a scale-up SAP HANA 2 landscape with 2nd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable
                                processors, DRAM, and Intel Optane DC persistent memory provided up to 52 percent2 more
                                total system memory at a lower cost, compared with a scale-out landscape with 2nd Gen
                                Intel Xeon Scalable processors and DRAM only</li>
                            <li>Ultimately, implementing scale-up servers will help Intel IT to provide Intel supply
                                chain analysts with faster insights from its supply chain data for a lower total cost of
                                ownership, improving decision making and positioning the company for future growth and
                                success</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Business Challenge: Making the Supply Chain More Efficient</h5>
                        <p>Intel’s supply chain is vast and complex, spanning 63 countries—with more than 600 facilities
                            and 19,000 suppliers—fulfilling one million orders, and shipping one billion units per year.
                            As Intel’s business continues to grow, evolve, and accelerate, improving the efficiency and
                            agility of this supply chain is critical to Intel’s continued success.</p>
                        <p>Central to this, is advanced, real-time analytics. The ability to make rapid, data-driven
                            decisions to optimize order taking, resource procurement, manufacturing, testing, and final
                            product delivery across the supply chain is essential. But the analytics engines required at
                            scale are a major investment, and architectural decisions have multi-year,
                            multi-million-dollar implications.</p>
                        <p>Intel IT uses the SAP HANA 2 in-memory database with Cloudera Distribution for Hadoop* to
                            operate real-time analytics within Intel’s global supply chain. In the past, IT used a
                            scale-out approach to meet compute and memory requirements. But they wanted to investigate
                            the benefits of a scale-up system.</p>
                        <h5>Proof of Concept: Scale Out Versus Scale Up</h5>
                        <p>Intel IT ran a POC to evaluate the performance gains of switching to a single-node server
                            using Intel Optane DC persistent memory. Intel Optane DC persistent memory represents a new
                            way of managing data for demanding workloads like the SAP HANA platform. It is non-volatile,
                            meaning data does not need to be re-loaded from persistent storage to memory after a
                            shutdown. Meanwhile, it runs at near-DRAM speeds, keeping up with the performance needs and
                            expectations of complex SAP HANA environments, and their users.</p>
                        <p>Intel IT wanted to use the PoC to test the hypothesis that by limiting data transfer, one
                            scale-up node would offer superior performance over three scale-out nodes. It compared its
                            current SAP HANA 2 finance analytics cluster comprised of three Intel® Xeon® E7-8880
                            processor v3-based servers versus a single server based on 2nd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable
                            processors. Each older server had two terabytes of DRAM, for a total of six terabytes of
                            memory. The new single server was configured with 1.5 terabytes of DRAM and three terabytes
                            of Intel Optane DC persistent memory, for a total of 4.5 terabytes of memory—see figure 1.
                        </p>
                        <p>Intel IT’s SAP HANA* business analyst compared performance of Intel’s current SAP HANA 2
                            finance analytics cluster comprised of three four-year-old servers versus a single server
                            based on 2nd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors and Intel Optane DC persistent memory. For
                            this, they used an IT-developed automated test, comprised of 50 queries.</p>

                        <i>Figure 1: Comparing the performance of three Intel® Xeon® E7-8880 processor v3-based servers
                            versus a single server based on 2nd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors with Intel®
                            Optane™ DC persistent memory</i>
                        <p>Intel IT used an automated test comprised of 50 production queries and ran the test for three
                            hours. Once all the test had been performed on both the benchmark and the new Intel Optane
                            DC persistent memory-based system, Intel IT then removed the Intel Optane DC persistent
                            memory from the new system, reinstalled DRAM and ran the tests again.</p>
                        <p>The PoC showed that one scale-up server with 2nd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors and Intel
                            Optane DC persistent memory delivered an average 2.4x1 faster time to insights than a
                            four-year-old three-server system. Also, the time taken by SAP HANA 2 to generate the
                            performance plan on the first execution is significantly accelerated on the scale-up system.
                            This improvement in the first runtime is beneficial for ad-hoc queries, which are run once
                            and never again.</p>
                        <h5>Future Memory Capacity</h5>
                        <p>Intel IT also evaluated the benefits of refreshing its whole SAP HANA 2 landscape, or path to
                            production, with the 2nd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors and Intel Optane DC persistent
                            memory. This includes servers for lab, development and quality assurance, benchmarking,
                            production, disaster recovery, and production support.</p>
                        <p>Intel IT looked at two likely scenarios: a scale-out cluster with 21 four-socket servers and
                            63 terabytes of memory, or a scale-up cluster with eight eight-socket servers and 96
                            terabytes of memory—see figure 2. It found that a scale-up SAP HANA 2 landscape with 2nd Gen
                            Intel Xeon Scalable processors, DRAM, and Intel Optane DC persistent memory provided up to
                            52 percent2 more total system memory at a lower cost, compared with a scale-out landscape
                            with 2nd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors and DRAM only.
                        </p>
                        <figure>

                        <i>Figure 2. Comparing the capacity of 21 scale-out servers versus eight scale-up servers based
                            on Intel® Optane® DC persistent memory</i>
                        <h5>Business-Enabling Benefits</h5>
                        <p>By accelerating the time taken to return a query, the scale-up system will help Intel IT to
                            meet its challenge of providing Intel’s supply chain analysts with faster answers to their
                            business questions. Ultimately, this faster time to insight will speed decision making and
                            ensure Intel’s supply chain is agile and efficient—positioning the company for future
                            growth.</p>
                        <p>The scale up system will also help Intel IT to lower the total cost of ownership (TCO) of its
                            SAP HANA 2 landscape and significantly improve operational efficiency in its data center. By
                            reducing the overall number of servers needed, Intel IT will have fewer servers to patch,
                            land, power, and connect, resulting in time as well as cost savings.</p>
                        <p>From an application perspective, the scale up system also consolidates data tables around
                            data distribution since those writing and running queries do not have to redistribute and
                            repartition tables across nodes. Everything runs on the one system, improving utilization
                            and performance.</p>
                        <p>Finally, a scale-up system based on Intel Optane DC persistent memory offers huge benefits
                            with regards to scaling memory capacity. Being able to scale memory will offer Intel IT
                            greater flexibility as it adds more data into its SAP HANA environment.</p>
                        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                        <p>The PoC showed that implementing scale-up servers with 2nd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors
                            and Intel Optane DC persistent memory will provide Intel with fast and reliable insights
                            from its supply chain data for a lower total cost of ownership, helping Intel IT meet its
                            challenge of driving business efficiency while positioning the company for future growth and
                            success.</p>
                        <p>As a next step, Intel IT is testing SAP HANA Extension Nodes with Intel Optane DC persistent
                            memory at a ratio of 1:8 for warm tiering. This will allow the team to seamlessly integrate

                        <p>Intel IT plays a central role in increasing the value of Intel’s business. It continuously
                            works at the boundaries of innovation, developing data-driven solutions to improve Intel’s
                            operations and processes.</p>
                        <h5>Lessons Learned</h5>
                        <p>The key lesson that enterprises can learn from Intel IT’s experience is to ensure that
                            systems are built by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and then shipped rather than
                            trying to build the system on site.</p>
