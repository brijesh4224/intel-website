                                When migrating and managing workloads in the cloud, organizations can use cloud tools
                                that
                                help optimize performance and reduce costs.

                            <p>Placing and fine-tuning cloud workloads can be a challenge. Many cloud management
                                platforms
                                include workload optimization tools that enable more efficient use of resources, often
                                by
                                moving each application to the cluster that supports its specific performance and cost
                                requirements.</p>
                            <p>Intel works with a broad range of software vendors and cloud service providers (CSPs) to
                                provide access to Intel® platform technologies through software stack integration.</p>
                            <p>Intel also offers a variety of purpose-built cloud software tools designed to improve the
                                performance and cost-effectiveness of cloud computing operations at every stage of the
                                cloud journey.</p>
                            <p>Many of these cloud tools take advantage of hardware-enabled features in Intel® Xeon®
                                Scalable processors and other Intel® processors and platforms to help further improve
                                the price performance of cloud operations. Intel® technology-based cloud instances are
                                readily available from most CSPs worldwide, so organizations can take advantage of those
                                software tools and hardware-enabled features.</p>
                            <p>With Intel’s strong presence in the enterprise data center and among CSPs, cloud
                                migration can take advantage of a common hardware platform that supports compatibility,
                                flexibility, and scalability in the cloud. Intel® platforms and tools help to smooth the
                                transition from the on-premises infrastructure to private cloud, public cloud, hybrid
                                cloud, and multicloud deployments.</p>

                            <p>Migration to the cloud may begin with a “lift and shift” that transitions workloads from
                                the on-premises data center to a private cloud or hybrid cloud environment.
                                Unfortunately, many organizations have found that these deceptively simple migrations
                                can be accompanied by a mismatched allocation of cloud resources and significant cost
                                overruns.</p>
                            <p>Thorough premigration discovery and planning should take into account the organization’s
                                short- and long-term strategic objectives, as well as key requirements of all planned <a

                                Initial and ongoing cloud development must allow for flexibility and scalability to
                                accommodate an organization’s needs in an unpredictable future.</p>
                            <p>Cloud migration and management should be treated as strategic endeavors due to their
                                significant impact on the entire enterprise. A <a href="">FinOps</a> framework and
                                cross-disciplinary team can help to align IT, development, and financial leadership with
                                the organization’s overarching plans and objectives.</p>
                            <p>Cloud tools can support FinOps and help achieve business goals by optimizing workload
                                placement and the workloads themselves to accelerate time to market, improve
                                performance, and reduce the total cost of cloud-based operations.</p>
                            <p><a href="">Cloud management</a> platforms from vendors like Microsoft, Red Hat, SUSE
                                OpenStack, VMware, and Google Cloud can also offer visibility into hybrid cloud or
                                multicloud models with a unified view of all workloads.</p>
                            <p>These platforms can make it easier to move workloads dynamically among clouds and scale
                                resources up or down as needed. Consolidated cloud management dashboards within those
                                applications can also help to simplify policy control, automation, and information
                                tracking.</p>
                            <p>Performance optimization can also help improve operational efficiency to yield
                                significant cost reductions. Together with a global partner ecosystem, Intel delivers
                                solutions with quality, optimized performance, and energy efficiency that help reduce
                                costs and improve sustainability.</p>
                            <p>Qualified cloud partners who are members of the <a href="">Intel® Partner Alliance</a>
                                and the <a href="">Cloud Insider Community</a> can offer these and other cloud
                                optimization tools to their customers.</p>
                            <p>Intel® Cloud Partners can take advantage of additional resources at the <a href="">Intel®
