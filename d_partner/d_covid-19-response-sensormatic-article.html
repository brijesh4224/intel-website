                        <p>Shopping used to be many things to many people: a casual in-and-out; a chance for discovery,
                            or just part of a daily routine. But during this pandemic, shopping can now be an
                            anxiety-filled mission. To put shoppers at ease, companies are trying to create safer, more
                            comfortable environments by automating store occupancy and monitoring social distancing
                            compliance. Sensormatic Solutions is working with Intel to bring artificial intelligence
                            enhancements to in-store cameras and sensors to help stores operate safely, while also
                            laying the foundation for further innovation beyond the pandemic.</p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">A Track Record in Tracking Technologies</h2>
                        <p>Beginning in the mid-1990s, ShopperTrak installed sensors in thousands of stores, introducing
                            shopper traffic monitoring and conversion rate analysis. It led to new insights about the
                            customer journey as well as permanent changes in how businesses designed and staffed their
                            stores. Decades later, Sensormatic Solutions considered the challenge of how to help stores
                            navigate the new, rapidly changing rules of operating during COVID-19. Given the cost and
                            risk of using staff to monitor social distancing and occupancy rules, they realized
                            automating these processes could help save lives, reduce anxiety, and protect margins during
                            a vulnerable time.</p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">How AI Enables a Safer Store Experience</h2>
                        <p>Sensormatic Solutions worked quickly alongside Intel to help stores leverage existing sensor
                            and camera platforms to accomplish more complex tasks. Using complex analysis, stores could
                            track social distance by recognizing the difference between family groups in proximity and
                            close interactions between strangers.
                            While Intel® and Sensormatic Solutions had been working on a video AI solution for 18
                            months, they accelerated the deployment time in light of the pandemic. They leveraged Intel®
                            Vision Technology and Intel® processors designed to aggregate, analyze and run AI models in
                            stores. This powers the <a href="">Sensormatic IQ</a> platform with real-time store
                            insights, staffing suggestions and predictions for customer behavior.
                            Once set up, this technology can send employees important notices when stores reach maximum
                            occupancy. The <a href="">Sensormatic IQ</a> platform can enable specific staffing insights
                            to inform recommendations based on occupancy trends, such as indicating when employees
                            should be stationed at doors for crowd control.</p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Shoppers Are Setting New Expectations</h2>
                        <p>In a world more wary of human contact, where convenience and safety are always top of mind, a
                            “New Normal” has emerged. Retailers have embraced emerging technologies like transparent
                            in-store safety, contactless payments, responsive staffing and convenient fulfillment.
                            Cautious customers expect stores to do everything at their disposal to maintain order and
                            safety. Consumer surveys have found that 68% of respondents say it will take a long time (if
                            ever) for life to return to normal.1 That means it falls to stores to accommodate anxious
                            shoppers over the long term; hence, real-time occupancy and social distancing solutions are
                            a must.</p>

                        <p>The technology is already seeing a rush of enthusiastic adopters including retailers such as
                            department stores, home goods and furnishings, and even telecommunications providers. While
                            the initial focus was on essential stores, Sensormatic Solutions is now working to help
                            enable a broader set of businesses that are currently hoping to reopen and recover. The
                            demand for public safety monitoring goes beyond retail as Sensormatic Solutions has received
                            inquiries from everyone from sports complexes to casinos, libraries, and schools. Despite
                            the broad interest, Sensormatic Solutions is focusing on how they can help loyal customers
                            create smart, safe solutions.</p>
                        <p>“As retailers face their new reality as a result of COVID-19, we believe that the industry

                        </h2>
                        <p>Counting people and social distancing is just the beginning. With an Intel®-based, AI-ready
                            smart hub in each location, businesses over time can take advantage of emerging applications
                            for shopper engagement, shelf replenishment, quick service restaurants, exterior curbside
                            wait time, and more. The retail landscape continues to shift and evolve and with AI inside
                            stores, we’ll find a safer, smarter way to shop.
                            Creating safer, smarter ways to shop is wonderful — and Intel, with partners like
