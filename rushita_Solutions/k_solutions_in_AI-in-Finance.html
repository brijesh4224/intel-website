                        <p class="k_plink1 k_bluehover1">The rapid evolution of AI is changing the world, and the <a
                                href="#">financial services industry</a>&nbsp;is no exception. Businesses in this sector
                            are striving to accelerate insights, respond faster, predict more accurately, and enhance
                            their overall customer experience.</p>
                        <p>Of course, the financial services industry remains highly competitive and subject to
                            stringent industry regulations. These industry dynamics strongly influence how technology is
                            adopted within the industry and require financial institutions to continuously identify new
                            ways to differentiate their capabilities using technology.</p>
                        <p>As a result, there are many compelling use cases for AI in financial services as the industry
                            strives to deliver new value and services around data. Increased use of AI in financial
                            services allows institutions to streamline core business processes while adding innovative
                            products and services that improve customers’ experiences. Financial services companies are

                                sets.<sup>1</sup></li>
                            <li><strong>81 percent</strong> said that AI is a critical part of their strategy to attract

                            they progress on their AI journeys. AI solutions depend on large quantities of data, often
                            harnessed from multiple sources. Organizations in the financial sector need to protect their
                            customers’ data and ensure they align with regulations as they pursue AI innovation, even
                            when they’re sharing information with other vendors or third-party technology providers.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">AI in Banking</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_bluehover1">In the <a href="#">banking industry</a>, artificial
                            intelligence helps companies automate business-critical processes such as risk management
                            and fraud prevention while unlocking new capabilities, such as the use of chatbots and
                            intelligent recommender systems for retail banks. The <a href="#">future of
                                banking</a>&nbsp;will see increased integration and connection between physical and
                            digital platforms—with smarter recommendations for customers and automated detection of
                            fraud and crime.</p>
                        <h3>Fighting Financial Crime</h3>
                        <p>Banks are bound by a complex set of laws and programs that are designed to uncover the
                            financing of criminal activities, both domestically and internationally. For example, the
                            International Monetary Fund, as well as the US and other countries, have established
                            anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, requiring financial institutions to maintain AML
                            programs and report suspicious activities.<sup>2</sup></p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_bluehover1">While many of these regulations have proven expensive for
                            banks, the rules have been largely ineffective at preventing or deterring financial crime.
                            Legacy hardware has created a barrier to success, as older systems lack the scale to combat
                            threats and manage complex databases across various business units. Further, <a href="#">AML
                                measures</a>&nbsp;increasingly require real-time analysis to enable faster transactions
                            or support online capabilities. As a result, companies are turning to artificial
                            intelligence to navigate industry regulation and increase efficiency through real-time
                            analysis.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_bluehover1">Many banking organizations currently use AI technologies to
                            automate fraud detection at every level across their organization. This is best demonstrated
                            by <a href="#">PayPal</a>, who improved the detection of fraudulent transactions using
                            Intel® technologies integrated into a real-time data platform from Aerospike. Key results
                            included a 30x reduction in the number of missed fraud transactions with a 3x reduction in
                            hardware cost.<sup>3</sup></p>
                        <h3>The Connected Branch and Online Platform</h3>
                        <p>Banking organizations are using AI to deliver a holistic customer experience with
                            personalized banking that’s integrated regardless of where customers are—at home, on the go,
                            or in the branch.</p>
                        <p>In addition to modernizing traditional processes, artificial intelligence can be used to
                            deliver enhanced customer experiences through new services and capabilities. In retail
                            banking, the latest technologies enable banks to understand customers’ needs and offer
                            personalized banking services that are tailored to each individual. Intelligent automation
                            helps streamline the customer experience and speed processes throughout banking
                            organizations. Online chatbots also allow customers to enjoy smoother self-service
                            experiences that can be more convenient than a phone call or in-person visit.</p>
                        <p>Inside the branch, AI-enabled machine vision solutions help bridge the gap between the
                            physical space and digital channels, including on-site kiosks. For example, machine
                            vision‒based sensors can track customers’ gaze, posture, and gestures; assess wait times;
                            and alert bank employees when a customer needs assistance. These AI-enabled solutions
                            analyze behavioral data from the branch and from online channels. The resulting intelligence
                            is used to individualize and optimize purchasing, placement, and timing of marketing
                            displays and campaigns.</p>
                        <p>Across physical and digital operations, AI is also helping banks conduct faster and
                            more-efficient Know Your Customer (KYC) initiatives, which are critical to controlling risks
                            and verifying customer identities. AI-enhanced KYC solutions often include technologies such
                            as biometric identification, intelligent document processing, and real-time transaction
                            monitoring.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">AI in Capital Markets</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_bluehover1">Artificial intelligence is also being used by financial
                            institutions operating in <a href="#">capital markets</a>—asset managers and hedge funds,
                            among others—to improve efficiency and deploy new capabilities. AI technology is often used
                            to support risk management processes in addition to optimizing trading strategies for a
                            variety of financial instruments.</p>
                        <h3>Liquidity and Risk Management in Trading</h3>
                        <p>AI can help investment banks and other financial institutions comply with a new set of
                            international regulations called Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB). Beginning in
                            January 2023, financial institutions will need to calculate all risks associated with their
                            trading positions in securities, commodities, foreign currencies, and other investments.
                            Because of the massive scale, FRTB compliance will rely on complex financial modeling,
                            simulations, and impact studies that require enormous investments in computational power and
                            data storage capacity.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_bluehover1">Artificial intelligence can be used to significantly increase
                            the speed at which this analysis is completed. For example, software vendors such as <a
                                href="#">Matlogica</a>&nbsp;and <a href="#">Quantifi</a>&nbsp;achieved significant
                            performance improvements through a variety of valuation adjustment (xVA) models based on
                            machine learning and deep neural networks. These AI-enabled enhancements help capital
                            markets companies remain compliant while significantly improving the efficiency of their
                            risk models.</p>
                        <h3>Algorithmic Trading</h3>
                        <p>Within capital markets, AI is also enabling new capabilities, including real-time analysis
                            that supports algorithmic trading. Financial trading is based on patterns that are revealed
                            in a history of market behavior and transactions. Recently, companies have begun using AI
                            capabilities to deploy algorithmic trading that relies on machine learning, neural networks,
                            and predictive analytics to interpret and respond to market signals within microseconds.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">AI in Insurance and Payments</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_bluehover1">Finally, artificial intelligence is being used by <a
                                href="#">insurance</a>&nbsp;and payment companies to automate processes, improve
                            efficiency, and deploy new capabilities.</p>
                        <h3>Underwriting and Claims Management</h3>
                        <p>Within the insurance industry, companies are deploying predictive models to streamline the
                            underwriting and claims management process with artificial intelligence.</p>
                        <p>During customer onboarding, insurers can assess an applicant’s risk factors at a given time.
                            These increasingly sophisticated models rely on machine learning to analyze a variety of
                            factors (e.g., credit, health) to offer a customized premium for their insurance services.
                            Once a customer is onboarded, insurance companies are using AI to receive and process
                            insurance claims with high performance and accuracy. This enables customers to receive
                            insurance services quickly and efficiently. These processes are enabled by robotic process
                            automation technology, which is a machine learning technique that enables hyper automation
                            of various tasks.</p>
                        <h3>Fraud Detection</h3>
                        <p>Like their counterparts in banking, insurance and payment companies are deploying fraud
                            detection based on natural language processing algorithms to automatically help detect
                            criminal activities—or even predict them before they happen.</p>
                        <h3>Recommendation Engines</h3>
                        <p>Payment processors and credit card issuers also deploy recommendation engines to predict the
                            preferences of customers and prospects. The institutions then offer personalized banking
                            services to those prospects whose demographic profile and behavior either follow a
                            discernable pattern of their own or resemble a similar group whose behaviors are known.</p>
                        <p>The machine learning‒based recommendation engine analyzes vast amounts of preference data to
                            choose the best fit between product and prospect. These engines are similar to those used in
                            e-commerce stores or streaming media services that recommend additional items based on an
                            individual’s past purchases and on related purchases by other customers with a similar
                            history.</p>
