                                simplest form of AI and does not have the ability to form memory or use past experiences
                                to form new output. It can be used for administrative automation and student assessment.
                            </li>
                            <li>Predictive AI, using statistical algorithms, can identify patterns in past events or
                                data collected and make predictions about future events. In education, it can be used
                                for personalized learning or to detect students at risk of dropping out.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3><strong>Use Cases</strong></h3>
                        <p>Examples of how AI can be applied in education include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Student engagement:</strong> AI in education can support language learning to
                                bridge potential gaps in understanding. Students can prepare for tests through
                                personalized AI-enabled applications. They can also learn from their peers and virtual
                                exchanges in online discussion boards and through curriculum gamification.</li>
                            <li><strong>Attendance taking:</strong> Administrators and office staff can use AI to help
                                track student attendance, record known or unplanned absences, or notify parents about
                                tardiness.</li>
                            <li><strong>Classroom management:</strong> AI-enabled systems can help teachers monitor
                                student activities, especially for personalized learning plans, group labs, workshops,
                                or hybrid learning experiences. Teachers can see student progress more easily and have
                                more time to support emotional-cognitive learning and behavior management as needed.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Essay scoring:</strong> Teachers can use AI systems to review students’ essays
                                as a first pass and check for grammar, sentence structure, and plagiarism. AI can also
                                help determine whether students accurately understood their assignments and correctly
                                followed a writing prompt.</li>
                            <li><strong>Student and class comprehension:</strong> Teachers have options for
                                automatically determining student scores on tests, depending on the test-taking method.
                                AI-enabled systems can help instructors identify general comprehension of certain
                                subjects based on individual and collective scores on assignments and tests. This can
                                inform lesson planning, how materials are presented in class, the creation of
                                personalized learning plans based on individual knowledge gaps, or even curriculum
                                changes to improve learning performance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Near-real-time notes:</strong> AI systems can help students with visual or
                                auditory impairments by recording lectures and using speech-to-text technology. If
                                students have trouble focusing in class because they’re busy trying to take notes, AI
                                can create a transcript synced with an audio recording so students can go back and
                                listen to or read what a teacher said at a specific moment. This also frees teacher time
                                from providing lesson recaps and notes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> It takes an ecosystem to support student education.
                                Connecting parents, teachers, and administrators more efficiently can help improve the
                                learning experience. From event scheduling to concerns reporting to recognition for
                                student achievement and presentations, AI-enabled messaging and videoconferencing
                                capabilities can facilitate access for communication among all stakeholders.</li>
                            <li><strong>Intelligent campus:</strong> AI systems can help monitor campus environments and
                                provide valuable insights for administrators, visitors, and staff. For example, AI can
                                collect student metrics for both on-site and digital class attendance. It can also be
                                used to monitor pedestrian and traffic flow for usage patterns, identify potential
                                on-campus safety hazards, and aid with smart parking, wayfinding, and crowd management.
                                AI-enabled robots can be used in various ways to help with maintenance and facility
                                management.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3><strong>Challenges of AI in Education</strong></h3>
                        <p>As with the adoption of any technology, understanding how, when, and where to use AI in
                            education must be a priority for today’s visionary educators and administrators.</p>
                        <p>As a foundation for AI in education, there must be a commitment to using&nbsp;<a
                                href="#">responsible AI</a>&nbsp;for transparency, accountability, inclusivity, and
                            governance to support societal trust, critical thinking, and deep reasoning. Even so, there
                            are scenarios that need to be considered for all AI initiatives in schools:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Student misuse:</strong> The risk of students cheating raises ethical issues and
                                undermines their ability to learn the necessary content and skills. Additionally,
                                students may swap or forget their devices or password credentials, which can be a
                                security risk.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bias in algorithms:</strong> AI systems learn from the data they are trained on.
                                If this data contains biases like gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic segment, the AI
                                system can learn and perpetuate those biases.</li>
                            <li><strong>Equitable access:</strong> Not all students have access to AI tools and the
                                internet, with a risk that the digital gap may widen if access is not enabled for all.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Decreased student engagement:</strong> There is a risk that students who spend
                                more time with AI tools may engage less with educators and other students.</li>
                            <li><strong>Teacher burnout:</strong> The teacher device is the most used tool in the modern
                                classroom for instruction, administrative tasks, and communication. At the same time,
                                teacher burnout is leading to increased turnover and staff shortages. Providing
                                AI-enhanced tools can help improve teacher satisfaction.</li>
                            <li><strong>Systems implementation:</strong> Upgrading existing infrastructure and devices
                                for today’s technologies and future-proofing to be ready for tomorrow’s educational
                                needs requires an investment of time and resources, including training personnel on how
                                to use AI effectively.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Most of these risks are not new but should be considered through the responsible use of AI.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5 pt-5" id="key4">The Future of AI in Education</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">The nature of jobs is transforming significantly. By 2027, an
                            estimated 83 million job roles globally—like bank tellers, postal service clerks, cashiers,
                            and ticket clerks—will become obsolete as the employment landscape shifts.<sup>5</sup> At
                            the same time, projections show that about 69 million fresh opportunities will emerge in

                        <p>Security will also continue to be a top priority. Educational institutions must develop a
                            security strategy that can withstand the challenges of a complex security landscape,
                            protecting user and data privacy on student, teacher, and staff devices and networked
                            infrastructure.</p>
                        <p>Educational institutions can take advantage of AI’s benefits today. Taking steps to
                            incorporate AI now will set a foundation for more easily capturing emerging possibilities
                            and use cases in the future.</p>
