                        <p>Innovative capabilities at the edge, facilitated by new advancements in performance and
                            efficiency, are poised to bring together the physical and digital worlds. Among the most
                            promising is edge AI, which extends artificial intelligence out from the data center to the
                            point where data is created to deliver real-time insights and make an even greater impact on
                            real-world outcomes. In combination with cloud and data center resources, edge AI unlocks a
                            complete end-to-end AI platform for your business, with enhanced support for real-time
                            insights, automation, agility, and other game-changing capabilities.</p>
                        <p>Like many businesses across the globe, your organization is likely already assessing the
                            potential of edge AI for your business and exploring how it can impact your operations.
                            You’ve likely seen examples of how early adopters are already achieving amazing things
                            through innovative AI-powered solutions and wondering how you can do the same.</p>
                        <p>In today’s business environment, quickly realizing value and staying ahead of your
                            competitors through edge AI is an imperative that remains top of mind across industries. To
                            help simplify and accelerate your journey to edge AI success, we’ve built a guide to the
                            challenges you need to prepare for and the various best practices, resources, and
                            technologies that can help you overcome them.</p>
                        <p>Let’s start by examining the most common hurdles that your business may encounter as you
                            pursue edge AI capabilities.</p>


                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Get Started with Edge AI</h3>
                        <p>Edge AI and its business use cases are a complex and multifaceted topic. As a result, your
                            organization will likely want to tackle AI enablement in phases. While the most-advanced and
                            wide-spanning use cases will require a sophisticated stack of edge-to-cloud technologies,
                            getting started with edge AI can be easier than you think.</p>
                        <p>As you begin exploring edge AI possibilities, keep in mind that your Intel-powered edge
                            environments are likely ready to get started with AI today. Existing edge compute resources,
                            like POS systems in your stores, industrial PCs, or local servers in healthcare offices, can
                            support many AI workloads, including <a

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Select Your Adoption Approach</h3>
                        <p>Organizations looking to extend AI applications to the edge generally fall into three
                            categories: those looking to purchase a purpose-built AI solution or application, those
                            looking to build their own AI application, and those looking to achieve their AI goals
                            through some combination of those two approaches.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of the approach your organization wants to take, Intel has resources,
                            technologies, and ecosystem partners that can help you achieve your goal. We’ve invested in

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Consider Your Potential Edge AI Challenges</h3>
                        <p>Whether facing staffing issues in healthcare, looking to enhance productivity and profitability on the factory floor, seeking to streamline processes and prevent loss in retail stores, or tackling any number of other complex challenges, edge AI helps enterprises solve real-world problems.</p>
                        <p>But applying AI to address these problems also requires extending AI-enhanced capabilities to the edge of the network—the point where data is created and consumed, such as the plant floor, the hospital, or the storefront. Bringing AI capabilities to these environments presents new challenges when compared to running AI in the data center or the cloud, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Adding AI to existing investments: </strong>Many edge environments feature legacy, fixed-function infrastructure with a variety of proprietary equipment and software. Space-constrained hardware needs to be able to support real-world requirements for accuracy and performance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Training and fine-tuning models:</strong> Edge AI models are unique and must be tuned for a specific industry or use-case dynamics. Human domain knowledge is often critical in these cases. For example, experienced weld inspectors can help AI understand how to detect good or bad welds. Enterprises need simple tools that help non‒data scientist experts transform their expertise into AI capabilities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Addressing hardware diversity:</strong> Edge-native applications will likely span a multitude of nodes, operating systems, connectivity protocols, compute and storage needs, energy and cost constraints, and compliance concerns. Developers need ways to deal with this complexity and support the distributed heterogeneous computing environment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Securing and managing distributed applications:</strong> Enterprises face new challenges as they seek to support advanced AI at the edge. Manageability is critical to applying AI at scale, and security is a necessity at every step along the way.</li>
                            <li><strong>Maximizing efficiency and reliability:</strong> Some edge environments place different kinds of stress on AI hardware, such as heat, moisture, or vibration. Edge AI solutions for use cases like traffic monitoring or quality assurance often need to be placed in areas with small amounts of physical real estate. Making it all happen with low power usage is also an important consideration for controlling costs and promoting sustainability.</li>
                        </ul>


                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Translate Domain Expertise into Data Science</h3>
                        <p>Enterprises require new methods to bridge the gap between the knowledge of their specialists and their AI algorithms. They need ways to, for example, allow medical specialists to train AI models to recognize anomalies in medical scans or for QA teams to show AI models how to pinpoint manufacturing flaws. To that end, you can use the <a href="#" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline">Intel® Geti™ platform</a>, an easy-to-use tool that helps non‒data scientists more easily train AI models through labeling, annotation, and active learning. With this solution, data scientists, domain experts, developers, and AI professionals can all work together in the same platform, which makes applying computer vision AI to enterprise challenges fast and effective.</p>
                        <p>The Intel® Geti™ platform works with most AI frameworks and exports trained computer vision AI that can run on the devices you already have. REST APIs and the Intel® Geti™ software development kit (SDK) enable enterprises to integrate the platform into their value chain so they can push data directly into it and pull trained models directly into deployment pipelines.</p>
