                        <p>Telecommunications (telco) providers face a slew of industry disruptions. The data demands of
                            5G, streaming media, and edge computing are increasing faster than the evolving capabilities
                            of the telecom networks that support them. And as competition between providers intensifies,
                            customers continue to expect more from their services.
                        </p>
                        <p>To keep pace with data speeds and meet customer expectations, AT&T, one of the world’s
                            largest telecommunications providers, has created a new paradigm for network equipment: a
                            software-centric model that puts customers first.</p>
                        <p>To move control of the network from hardware to software, AT&T has switched to using
                            disaggregated, decoupled, open components stacked to create switching or routing platforms.
                            This contrasts with legacy equipment available from single-source providers, which can be
                            hardware-centric and closed, and which often uses proprietary technologies.</p>
                        <p>AT&T has used an open model to develop its 100/400 Gb large Ethernet multiplexer (EMUX). The
                            AT&T team chose <a href="" style="color: #0068B5; text-decoration: underline  dashed !important;text-underline-offset: .3rem !important;">Intel® Virtual RAID on CPU (Intel® VROC)</a> for RAID 1 storage
                            in the EMUX to
                            enhance reliability, increase performance, and lower cost.</p>
                        <h2 class="fw-lighter" style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Intel VROC Snapshot</h2>
                        <p>Intel VROC, an integrated RAID solution, delivers top-tier reliability, performance, and
                            cost-effectiveness, making it an ideal solution for modern telco and data-centric demands.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Improved reliability:</b>Intel VROC increases system reliability by eliminating the need
                            for a RAID host bus adapter (HBA) card.</p>
                        <p><b>Increased performance:</b>Intel VROC delivers up to 165% higher performance compared to a
                            RAID HBA card.1</p>
                        <p><b>Lower cost:</b>Intel VROC provides up to 60% cost savings compared to a RAID HBA card.2
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="fw-lighter" style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">AT&T Open Network Equipment Model</h2>
                        <p>AT&T contributes specifications to the Open Compute Project (OCP) to implement its new
                            network equipment paradigm. OCP is an organization that shares designs for data center
                            products and best practices among industry-leading technology companies. AT&T’s contribution
                            attracts organizations interested in expanding their market reach. By building to AT&T’s
                            open specifications, original design manufacturers (ODMs), original equipment manufacturers
                            (OEMs), independent software vendors (ISVs), and systems integrators (SIs) can gain access
                            to new markets and customers as AT&T deploys its next-generation network infrastructure and
                            services. </p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 2.5rem;"><i>Figure 1. AT&T has shifted to an open architecture with common
                                hardware and flexible software.3</i></p>
                        <p>As the adoption of disaggregated routers and switches increases, the volume of disaggregated
                            equipment sold scales up. This helps to drive equipment prices down. With open, flexible
                            solutions, AT&T and its fellow telecom providers can harness innovative technologies at
                            lower prices and sooner than if they waited for single-source, proprietary solutions to
                            reach the market. Figure 1 illustrates how AT&T has moved from a conventional architecture
                            with proprietary hardware and software from single providers to an open, software-based
                            architecture with broad ecosystem support.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 2.5rem;"><i>AT&T 100/400 Gigabit Large EMUX</i></p>
                        <p>The AT&T large EMUX router is a specific example of a disaggregated equipment model designed
                            by AT&T that benefits customers with enhanced reliability, increased performance, and lower
                            costs. As new 400 gigabit Ethernet (GbE) networks come online, network providers must
                            multiplex edge traffic running on 100 GbE networks to 400 GbE networks. The 100/400 Gb large
                            EMUX addresses this need (see Figure 2).</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 2.5rem;"><i>Figure 2. EMUX router system block diagram showing the role of
                                Intel VROC and Intel® Volume Management Device (Intel® VMD).</i></p>
                        <P>The AT&T team, working with other industry partners, designed the EMUX to efficiently
                            pre-aggregate traffic from 100 GbE to 400 GbE platforms. The EMUX design aggregates multiple
                            traffic streams from broadband, mobile, and enterprise networks into a single pipeline, thus
                            simplifying edge sites.</P>
                        <p>AT&T guided innovation and interoperability for this router by specifying design features,
                            including the chassis, networking, CPU, storage, motherboard, power system, security, and
                            hardware management. The design has been released as an OCP specification. When building out
                            the EMUX for production, AT&T specified a multi-core Intel® Xeon® processor with Intel VROC
                            for RAID 1 storage for the EMUX platform as it is compatible with the open specifications.
                            The Intel VROC design enhances the reliability needed to support solid-state drive (SSD)
                            failure scenarios when mission-critical applications require instantaneous drive failover.
                            It also increases storage performance due to the direct connection of SSDs to the CPU.</p>

                        <h2 class="fw-lighter" style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">What is RAID?</h2>
                        <p>RAID stands for "redundant array of independent disks." RAID is a technology used in data
                            storage to improve data fault tolerance, redundancy, and performance by combining multiple
                            physical hard drives into a single logical unit. In storage systems, RAID helps ensure data
                            availability and protection against drive failures.</p>
                        <p>RAID can be configured in various ways to best meet organizations’ redundancy needs. For
                            example, AT&T uses Intel VROC as RAID 1 storage in its 100/400 Gb large EMUX router. RAID 1
                            consists of an exact copy of a set of data on two or more disks, referred to as “mirroring.”
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="fw-lighter" style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Intel VROC Overview</h2>
                        <p>Intel VROC is an integrated RAID solution on Intel Xeon processors that provides reliability,
                            availability, and serviceability (RAS) for NVM Express (NVMe) storage. Intel VROC is enabled
                            via Intel® Volume Management Device (Intel® VMD), an integrated hardware accelerator.
                        </p>
                        <p>Legacy hardware RAID products traditionally isolate the storage subsystem behind a discrete
                            adapter, called the RAID host bus adapter (HBA) card. A RAID HBA card controls RAID arrays
                            and is an intermediary between the storage devices and the host. Use of an HBA card was
                            ideal for slower storage technologies, but with faster NVMe storage, a fundamentally new
                            RAID architecture is needed. The Intel VROC integrated RAID solution takes the robust
                            functionality and enterprise quality of hardware RAID and combines it with the flexibility
                            and upgradability of software RAID to address this need.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 2.5rem;"><i>Figure 3. Intel VROC eliminates the need for an HBA card;
                                fewer system components increase system reliability.</i></p>
                        <h2 class="fw-lighter" style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Roadmap</h2>
                        <p>Intel has a comprehensive roadmap for Intel VROC, including upcoming support for capabilities
                            like local key management through a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for self-encrypting
                            drives, out-of-band management (OOB) integration with AMI BIOS, NVMe secure erase through
                            Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), data RAID 0 and RAID 5 capability for VMware
                            ESXi, OOB/Redfish enhancements, and user experience (UX) enhancements. Reach out to your
                            Intel representative for further information.</p>

                            system log file. These messages can be found within most Linux distributions inside
                            “/var/log/messages.” Any triggered events will be reported to syslog and can be monitored
                            and filtered by the user. End users can also define their own event messages using the
                            “/etc/mdadm.conf” file. The user-defined messages are called by the monitoring service when
                            an alert is detected. These messages are printed to the “/tmp/vroc_alerts.log” file, and the
                            user can develop their own method of handling these user-defined messages. </p>
                        <h2 class="fw-lighter" style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Best-in-Class Redundant Boot Solution</h2>
                        <p>To improve uptime and reduce the chance of system failure, many systems use a redundant
                            operating system (OS) image volume by using RAID 1 with two mirrored storage devices.
                            Because pre-boot support and functionality outside the OS are required for RAID 1, hardware
                            RAID solutions have been the only option for these server designs until recently. With Intel
                            VROC, this functionality can now be delivered as an embedded platform feature without
                            additional hardware. Intel VROC UEFI drivers are integrated with platform BIOS images,
                            meaning that RAID 1 boot volumes can be created in the pre-boot environment and managed by
                            the Intel VROC RAID stack. This allows for a cost-effective and flexible RAID 1 boot
                            solution that can connect directly to Intel VMD domains on the CPU or the platform
                            controller hub (PCH) with various form factors (M.2, U.2, and E1.S).</p>
                        <h2 class="fw-lighter" style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Superior Reliability</h2>
                        <p>In contrast to traditional hardware-based RAID solutions, Intel VROC uses hardware and
                            software to provide reliable, cost-effective, high-performance protection against data loss.
                            Enterprises can use Intel VROC to help deliver consistent performance even during a fault,
                            meaning that enterprise workloads have a far better chance of meeting service-level
                            agreements (SLAs) in the event of drive failures.</p>
                        <p>Intel VROC provides equal, if not better, value than a hardware RAID solution by delivering
                            several key benefits:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Can significantly shorten rebuild times while still providing excellent performance
                                (input/output operations per second, [IOPS]), resulting in minimal impact on service
                                levels for demanding application workloads—a critical factor for a business’ response to
                                inevitable drive failures. In addition, the difference in CPU utilization between Intel
                                VROC and HBA-based systems is minimal.</li>
                            <li>Allows NVMe system users to avoid RAID 6 performance overhead without sacrificing data
                                reliability by utilizing a RAID 5 with hot spare configuration.</li>
                            <li>Protects data during power loss using a patented journaling method that closes the RAID
                                5 write hole completely.</li>
                            <li>Offers flexibility for OEMs, ODMs, or end users to certify NVMe drives using
                                self-certification tools offered by Intel.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>An HBA-based RAID system acts as a single point of failure and contributes to lower hardware
                            mean time between failures (MTBF). However, Intel VROC does not require additional hardware
                            components and, therefore, does not impact hardware MTBF. Also, HBA-based RAID cards have
                            backup batteries that can significantly impact system hardware MTBF and add complexity and
                            cost.</p>
                        <h2 class="fw-lighter" style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Intel VROC in the AT&T Large EMUX</h2>
                        <p>The AT&T design team used Intel VROC, integrated directly into the BIOS/UEFI firmware, for
                            RAID 1 storage within the AT&T large EMUX router and AT&T Distributed Disaggregated Chassis
                            (DDC) products. RAID 1, which generates mirroring, brings invaluable benefits to data
                            storage. With mirrored disks, RAID 1 ensures data redundancy, allowing the system to
                            maintain seamless operation even if one disk fails. This provides fault tolerance and
                            safeguards data integrity with identical copies. Intel VROC eliminates the need for an HBA
                            card in the system, resulting in enhanced reliability, reduced supply-chain complexity, and
                            lowered costs in terms of initial investment and ongoing maintenance. Eliminating the HBA
                            card improves overall reliability by minimizing potential points of failure, and it
                            contributes to increased energy efficiency and improved thermal performance.</p>
