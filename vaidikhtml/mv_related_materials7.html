                        <h3>Extract the Value of Confidential Data in its Encrypted State</h3>
                        <p>
                            Financial institutions (FIs) benefit from sharing data to improve their customers’
                            experiences and to help manage risk. But they must also ensure compliance with
                            data-management and privacy regulations. FIs must secure their data to protect both
                            sensitive customer information and critical intellectual property (IP). This can create
                            potential challenges because securing data throughout its lifecycle, including encryption
                            and decryption, can be complex and computationally intensive.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Enterprises such as banks and insurance companies in the financial sector have recently
                            begun adopting homomorphic encryption (HE) to combat these challenges. HE allows FIs to
                            perform computations on encrypted data without decrypting it. This technology enables FIs to
                            share data without revealing sensitive information, and to accelerate their overall system
                            performance. With this capability, these institutions can collaborate on sensitive datasets
                            using emerging artificial intelligence (AI) or hybrid cloud technologies without
                            compromising privacy.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To help FIs get more from their data with HE, Intel has taken a holistic approach to support
                            industry-wide HE adoption. Intel is helping organizations deploy HE through hardware-enabled
                            acceleration, software toolkits, and ecosystem optimizations with key partners. Intel’s
                            portfolio of built-in accelerators—including Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel
                            AVX-512), Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX), and more—on high-performing Intel
                            platforms has enabled well-known FIs to realize the benefits from HE today.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Bringing HE to Financial Services</h3>
                        <p>
                            HE is a cryptographic technique that enables computation and collaboration on data while
                            preserving confidentiality. Computing advances in the last decade have set the stage for HE
                            to become more widely adopted. HE is now at the inflection point where its overall
                            performance is already suitable for a variety of use scenarios. In particular, those in
                            regulated industries stand to benefit greatly, such as in finance, where preserving the
                            privacy and confidentiality of data is paramount.

                        <h3>Fighting Crime and Managing Risk</h3>
                        <p>
                            HE is a cryptographic technique that enables computation and collaboration on data while
                            preserving confidentiality. Computing advances in the HE can help FIs address longstanding
                            challenges, such as fraud. FIs must follow a complex set of laws and programs that are
                            designed to deter or uncover the financing of criminal activities. But compliance is
                            expensive, and regulations have mixed results in preventing crime. Legacy hardware used by
                            FIs often lacks the ability to scale to combat threats across business units.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            HE also helps FIs gain deeper insight for areas such as risk assessment. After the U.S.
                            housing crisis of 2008, global regulators established new compliance measures that require
                            FIs to calculate the valuation and risk associated with housing investments. HE can be used
                            to significantly increase the speed at which risk-management analysis is conducted while
                            keeping data private.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Intel has been working closely with financial organizations to help them integrate HE and
                            benefit in these and other ways. The following sections provide two examples.

                        <p>
                            Nasdaq, the American stock exchange based in New York City, makes use of the
                            crypto-acceleration instructions in 3rd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors to speed up
                            computation for its HE applications. Nasdaq uses HE to enable AI and machine learning (ML)
                            on large datasets. The stock exchange has been experimenting with HE in strengthening
                            technology solutions that detect financial crimes, such as money laundering and fraud, while
                            also complying with data-privacy regulations.

                        <h3>WeBank: Accelerating Federated Learning</h3>
                        <p>
                            WeBank, the first digital bank in China, strives to provide more convenient financial
                            services to micro-sized, small, and medium-sized enterprises and the public. WeBank is an
                            active explorer and participant in federated learning, which is a t ype of ML in which a set
                            of client computers collaboratively trains a model on local data. Everything is orchestrated
                            by a central server without sharing the raw data.1 Federated learning can be applied by
                            those in the financial industry to manage credit risks through AI-based risk-control models
                            to reduce the rate of non-performing loans. This technique requires an abundant and rich
                            source of data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            WeBank has led the way in federated learning by releasing an industrial open source
                            framework, called Federated AI Technology Enabler (FATE), to help improve the convenience
                            and efficiency of building a federated learning solution. WeBank partnered with Intel to
                            accelerate HE on FATEbased solutions built on 3rd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors with
                            the integrated Intel AVX-512 instruction set, which has helped improve the company’s overall
                            operating efficiencies by up to 4.7x.2

                        <h3>The Intel Platform for HE</h3>
                        <p>
                            Intel has been on the forefront of building a software and hardware platform for HE
                            computation. 3rd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors include built-in accelerators that can
                            deliver optimized performance across heavy workloads such as HE. These built-in accelerators
                            mean that there is no need to add more CPU cores or discrete accelerator hardware to meet
                            the performance requirements for HE and a wide variety of other workloads and use cases.

                        <h3>The Intel Platform for HE</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Intel platform for HE is a modular design that allows new components to be incorporated
                            or updated as they become available.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The accelerated math libraries layer includes the open source Intel Homomorphic Encryption
                            Acceleration Library (Intel HEXL), which implements CPU-based acceleration of mathematical
                            operations, capable of delivering up to 7.2x speedup in calculations compared to a native
                            C++ implementation.3 Above this layer are the HE libraries that use Intel HEXL for
                            acceleration, including HElib, Microsoft SEAL, and PALISADE.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The <a href="">Intel Homomorphic Encryption Toolkit (Intel HE Toolkit)</a> is designed to
                            make it easier
                            for new HE users to get started evaluating and deploying HE on Intel platforms. Like Intel
                            HEXL, the Intel HE Toolkit takes advantage of the latest Intel AVX-512 instructions to
                            accelerate encryption on shared datasets. The Intel HE Toolkit also offers numerous kernel
                            examples of how HE libraries can be used to implement mathematical operations.
