                        <p>TACC is a leading supercomputing facility for academic researchers in the U.S. The center is
                            always looking to the next generation of computing capabilities to continue to support the
                            grand challenges facing science. When looking to replace the Stampede2 system—an Intel/Dell
                            Technologies system that is the workhorse of the U.S. academic HPC community—TACC evaluated
                            performance of scientific codes on the Intel® Xeon® CPU Max Series, a processor family with
                            High Bandwidth Memory (HBM).</p>
                        <p>HBM has been one of the key ingredients in the rise of GPUs. It was also instrumental in the
                            <a href=""> 2020 and 2021 Top500 #1 world ranking of the Fugaku supercomputer</a>, which
                            includes
                            HBM-powered processors. The Intel Xeon CPU Max Series is the first x86 CPU to integrate HBM.
                        </p>
                        <p>To evaluate performance of the new processor, TACC used a host of real-world HPC applications
                            that are part of the NSF-funded Characteristic Science Applications (CSA) program. Through
                            the CSA program, TACC collaborates with researchers to prepare scientific applications for
                            the Leadership-Class Computing Facility (LCCF), which will host the agency’s flagship
                            supercomputer, codenamed Horizon, expected to arrive in 2026. The applications were
                            identified by the community of large-scale scientific computing users. They reflect the
                            broad range of science domains and computational approaches—from language to method to
                            workflow—that researchers will run on future supercomputers.</p>

                        <p>TACC researchers benchmarked 13 of the CSA codes and the Weather Research and Forecasting
                            (WRF) code on the Intel Xeon CPU Max Series. Table 1 lists the codes used. The same codes
                            were benchmarked on 2nd Gen Intel® Xeon® processors of Frontera—TACC’s most powerful
                            capability computing systems and currently #21 on the June 2023 Top500 list.</p>
                        <p>The Intel Xeon CPU Max Series can run in a variety of modes—including an HBM-only mode and a
                            flat mode where HBM can be turned off, relying only on DDR5. TACC tested the efficacy of the
                            Intel Xeon CPU Max Series in both of these memory modes to understand the performance
                            characteristics and benefits of HBM vs. DDR5. The Intel Xeon CPU Max Series delivered
                            significant performance gains in both modes, especially for memory-bandwidth-bound
                            applications.</p>

                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Results</h2>
                        <p>Both modes delivered significant gains over the 2nd Gen Intel Xeon processors that power the
                            TACC Frontera supercomputer. For example, with DDR5 memory only, the codes ran 2x faster on
                            average than the previous version.1 For massively parallel, data-hungry, and
                            memory-bandwidth-limited problems, however, the Intel Xeon CPU Max Series with HBM excelled
                            even more—with a 2.6x average speed-up.1</p>
                        <p>More than a third of the codes run on the Intel Xeon CPU Max Series with HBM saw 50 percent
                            or more performance improvements over running only DDR5. Some codes saw up to 2x faster
                            performance with the addition of HBM.</p>
                        <p>“The new Intel Xeon CPU Max Series has exactly twice as many cores as the 2nd Gen Intel Xeon
                            processor, so I expect it will be at least two times better,” said John Cazes, TACC Director
                            of HPC. “With HBM, however, it’s 2.6x, so it’s a great multiplier. It’s got enough memory
                            bandwidth that the cores on the Intel Xeon CPU Max Series cannot saturate the memory
                            bandwidth that HBM provides. This is a very rare problem to have on a CPU.”</p>

                        <p>Among the 14 applications that were assessed are software for large international
                            experiments, like the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, widely used codes from the earthquake
                            and astrophysics communities, and custom codes that explore innovative approaches to machine
                            learning and black hole modeling. Refer to Figure 1.</p>

                        <p>One code seeing significant performance improvements with HBM is a special configuration of
                            the Community Earth System Model (CESM) being developed by the NSF-sponsored EarthWorks
                            project, led by Colorado State University, to study seasonal weather and climate phenomena
                            at ultra-high resolutions. CESM is one of the principal climate codes used by the earth
                            science community. CESM is developed and maintained by the National Center for Atmospheric
                            Research (NCAR) in collaboration with the research community. The EarthWorks configuration
                            of CESM was 2.5x faster on the Intel Xeon CPU Max Series with DDR5 than on Frontera;1 the
                            code achieved a further 30 percent improvement (to 3.2x) in HBM-only mode.1</p>
                        <p>“Applying the power of new technologies will enable us to develop global storm-resolving
                            models that will help us better understand the risks that come with climate change,” said
                            Colorado State University professor David Randall, one of the developers of the EarthWorks
                            configuration. “A 2.5x to 3x speedup means we can find answers faster or increase the
                            resolution and accuracy of our models even further.”</p>

                        <p>The Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) is another state-of-the-art numerical

                            applications. WRF saw 2.09x speedup on the Intel Xeon CPU Max Series processor with DDR5

                        <p>Another code that is showing exceptional performance on both Intel Xeon CPU Max Series memory
                            modes is the 3D earthquake code, Anelastic Wave Propagation (AWP). The code was developed by
                            Yifeng Cui of the San Diego Supercomputer Center. The code ran 3.7x faster on Intel Xeon CPU
                            Max Series than on Frontera and showed a 100 percent boost with HBM.1</p>
                        <p>For applications that are not yet optimiz ed to take advantage of HBM, Cazes believes the
                            availability of Intel Xeon CPU Max Series will lead to code and algorithmic changes.</p>
                        <p>“We believe the high bandwidth memory of the Intel Xeon CPU Max Series nodes will help
                            deliver better performance than any other CPU that our users have seen before,” Stanzione
                            said. “They offer more than double the memory bandwidth performance per core over the
                            current 2nd and 3rd Gen Intel Xeon processor nodes in Stampede2. We look forward to
                            deploying Stampede3 as the next high capability and capacity HPC system in the national
                            cyberinfrastructure available to all open science research projects in the U.S.”</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">No Code Changes Required</h2>
                        <p>Porting codes is always a consideration when looking at new CPU architectures. The time and
                            effort it takes to develop and optimize a code reduces cycles available for the scientific
                            effort. For many small teams, it is prohibitively hard to port complicated, multi-dependency
                            legacy codes to GPUs.</p>

                            generation of Intel data center processors. This is beneficial for the thousands of codes
                            and billions of lines of scientific software that scientists have optimized for x86
                            processors.</p>
                        <p>“Because we have the same system libraries, I could just lift the binaries that we ran on

                        <p>Performance of these codes on the latest Intel Xeon processors is compelling. Adding to
                            performance, the ease with which the codes can be taken from Frontera directly to the newest

                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Summary</h2>
                        <p>Assessing 13 of the CSA codes and WRF, TACC’s evaluation shows considerable performance
                            boosts using both DDR5 and HBM-only modes of the Intel Xeon CPU Max Series compared to
                            Frontera. Most interesting are the benefits of HBM to many of the codes when run on the
                            Intel Xeon CPU Max Series. Speedup also comes in the form of scientists not needing to spend
                            time on porting codes across different systems and their CPUs.</p>
                        <p>“The use of accelerators and GPUs are definitely on the rise in HPC and AI, but it’s not
                            clear that much of the advantage isn’t provided by high bandwidth memory,” said Stanzione.
                            “We need high performance CPUs too, and based on our benchmarks, the Intel Xeon CPU Max
                            Series will provide clear advantages to our users.”</p>
