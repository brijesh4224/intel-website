                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Applying Digital Technology to Manufacturing</h2>
                        <p>For Audi, the secret to success is a commitment to using cutting-edge technology to build
                            high-quality vehicles that deliver precision engineering, exceptional performance, and
                            luxury. Audi auto manufacturing is very advanced with many production jobs, from spot
                            welding to riveting, fully automated. But their ultimate goal is to create smart factories
                            and achieve an Industry 4.0 level of production. To accomplish that goal, the Audi engineers
                            would need to move beyond the traditional approach of creating customized hardware and
                            software solutions to handle individual use cases. Instead, they would need a scalable and
                            flexible platform that would utilize advanced digital capabilities such as data analytics,
                            machine learning, and edge computing.</p>
                        <p>“If you look at factories today, Audi’s auto manufacturing operation is very advanced and
                            extremely sophisticated,” says Christine Boles, Vice President of the Internet of Things
                            Group and General Manager of the Industrial Solutions Division at Intel. “But custom-made
                            use cases are difficult to maintain and scale, and they can actually hinder innovation
                            because of the time and money required to get the necessary approvals and deploy individual
                            solutions. Audi was ready to look at things in a new way and try a different approach.”</p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Improving Quality Through Inline Inspection</h2>
                        <p>Audi partnered with Intel on a proof of concept experiment focused on improving the quality
                            control process for the welds on its vehicles. The POC took place at Audi’s factory in
                            Neckarsulm, Germany, one of the company’s two principal assembly plants.</p>
                        <p>The Neckarsulm plant has 2,500 autonomous robots on its production line. Each robot is
                            equipped with a tool, from glue guns to screwdrivers, and performs a specific task required
                            to assemble an Audi automobile. Nine hundred of those robots carry welding guns to do spot
                            welds that hold pieces of metal together. The production line is organized into a series of
                            cells and vehicles that are being assembled and move down the line from cell to cell. Each
                            cell can contain up to 20 robots and several milling machines. The milling machines are used
                            to clean on the welding guns, as needed, between operations.</p>
                        <p>Audi assembles up to approximately 1,000 vehicles every day at the Neckarsulm factory, and
                            there are 5,000 welds in each car—which equates to more than 5 million welds in a single day
                            of production. To ensure the quality of its welds, Audi performs manual quality control
                            inspections using the industry’s standard sampling method. “Audi pulls one car off the line
                            each day and takes it to a large room, where 18 engineers with clipboards use ultrasound
                            probes to test the welding spots and record the quality of every spot,” says Rita Wouhaybi,
                            Principal Engineer for the Internet of Things Group in the Industrial Solutions Division at
                            Intel and lead architect for Intel’s Industrial Edge Insights software.</p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Creating an Edge Solution That’s Scalable</h2>
                        <p>Together with Audi, Intel created algorithms for streaming analytics using Intel’s Industrial
                            Edge Insights software. The algorithms resulted in predictive analytics and modeling that
                            transformed factory data into valuable insights. The solution absorbs data from the
                            welding-gun controllers and analyzes it at the edge.</p>
                        <p>Intel’s data scientists created a machine-learning algorithm and trained it for accuracy by
                            comparing the predictions it generated to actual inspection data that Audi provided. The
                            model uses data generated by the welding controllers, which showed electric voltage and
                            current curves during the welding operation. The data also includes other parameters such as
                            the configuration of the welds, the types of metal, and the health of the electrodes. A
                            dashboard lets Audi employees visualize the data, and the system alerts technicians whenever
                            it detects a faulty weld or a potential change in the configuration that could minimize or
                            eliminate the faults altogether.</p>
                        <!-- <div class="d_img">
                            <img src="/img/darshan_image/img477.png" alt="">
                        </div> -->
                        <p><em>Figure 1. Audi’s solution ingests data from the welding-gun controllers and analyzes it
                                at the edge. A machine-learning algorithm was trained to detect faulty welds. Audi’s
                                solution ran an Intel® Xeon® processor, but it can scale from Intel® Core™ processors
                                all the way to Intel® Xeon® processor E and Intel® Xeon® scalable processors with no
                                changes to the software.</em></p>
                        <p>Optimizations on the factory floor can go beyond one process to the rest of the factory. Audi
                            can use this platform solution for other use cases involving robots and controllers such as
                            riveting, gluing and painting. “The value of putting the analytics platform at the edge is
                            that it allows you to draw more data into it and look at correlations, causalities, and
                            other interesting analytics—even some you might not think of at first,” says Brian McCarson,
                            Vice President of the Internet of Things Group and Director of Industrial Systems
                            Engineering and Architecture at Intel. “This platform gives Audi a lot of headroom. It’s not
                            just for this one use case. After making the initial platform investment, Audi can grow into
                            it and scale it across facilities and to other use cases.”</p>

                                        <p>This solution is like a blueprint for future solutions. We have a lot of
                                            technologies in the factory, and this is a model we can use to create
                                            quality inspection solutions for those other technologies so that we don’t
                                            have to rely on manual inspections.”—Henning Löser, Senior Manager Audi

                        </h2>
                        <p>Moving from manual inspections to an automated, data-driven process has allowed Audi to
                            increase the scope and accuracy of its quality control processes. But there are other
                            benefits that come along with that.</p>
                        <div class="row m-0 d_say1" id="">

                                        <p>At the Neckarsulm factory, we are already seeing a 30%-50% reduction in labor
                                            costs.”—Michael Häffner, Head of Production Planning, Automation and
                                            Digitization Audi</p>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>Häffner emphasized that increasing automation and efficiency is not about replacing workers,
                            but rather about giving them new knowledge and skills and creating new opportunities for
                            them. It’s also a necessity, because many skilled factory workers are retiring and taking
                            valuable knowledge with them. So automating some of those jobs and channeling younger
                            employees in new directions is good for the business and good for workers.</p>
                        <p>Another key benefit of the new system and the precise inspections it enables is that Audi can
                            be proactive and focus on avoiding problems rather than merely reacting to them. “Let’s say
                            we do an overall inspection of 5,000 or more welds on one car a day, and maybe 95% of those
                            welds are good and 5% are not,” Mathias Mayer says. “In the future, we can focus on the 5%
                            because we know where they are in the factory, and we can take action much sooner.”</p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Looking to the Future
                        </h2>
                        <p>Having a transparent system that lets Audi understand and learn from the data their equipment
                            is generating is inspiring them to consider new possibilities and providing additional
                            benefits—some of them unexpected. “Because of the analytics we are now running and the
                            increased visibility of our data, Audi lowered its corporate tax bill,” Häffner says. “In
                            the past, we had to make a lot of assumptions, and our taxes were based on those
                            assumptions. Now, the real data shows that our tax obligation is less, which is a
                            significant cost savings.”</p>
                        <p>Audi already has plans to use the platform for other use cases at the Neckarsulm factory, and
                            eventually intends to deploy predictive welding inspection and other solutions across all
                            Volkswagen Group production facilities. “We are at the very beginning of collecting and
                            analyzing our data,” Henning Löser says. “As we continue this journey, there will be many
                            more happy surprises and new opportunities for us.”</p>
                        <p>Building more precise cars, sustainably is wonderful—and Intel, with partners like Audi, is
                            how wonderful gets done.</p>
