                        <p><strong>AI Optimization for the Edge </strong></p>
                        <p>Intel also unveiled a new suite of processors for edge computing designed to provide
                            scalability and superior performance across diverse use cases. Intel Core Ultra processors
                            deliver remarkable power efficiency, making them ideal for AI workloads at the edge, with
                            performance gains that surpass competing products in critical metrics like media processing
                            and AI analytics.</p>
                        <p>New Intel® Core™ Ultra 9 processors show tremendous performance improvements in AI workloads
                            compared with the previous generation, setting a new benchmark for edge AI capabilities.
                            When comparing the Intel® Core™ Ultra 9 285H with the 185H, performance is up to 2.2x higher
                            in Procyon AI computer vision, up to 3.3x higher in Llama 3 8B and up to 2.3x higher in
                            stable diffusion 1.5<sup>10</sup>.</p>
                        <p>TOPS alone don’t define the real-world performance needs at the edge. The Intel® Core™ Ultra
                            7 processor – with about one-third fewer TOPS than Nvidia’s Jetson AGX Orin – beats its
                            competitor with media performance that is up to 5.6 x faster, video analytics performance
                            that is up to 3.4x faster and performance per watt per dollar up to 8.2x
