                            students while preparing them with modern skills to meet the demands of the 21st century
                            workforce. Choosing the right devices for learning and teaching is an important decision on
                            the journey to personalized learning. However, schools must also consider how the devices,
                            classroom technologies, and school campus will connect with and be supported by the
                            education IT infrastructure. A robust infrastructure gives students and educators secure
                            access to the Internet, cloud, data, apps, digital content, learning platforms, analytics,
                            and more, as they strive toward personalized, meaningful learning experiences enhanced with
                            technology.1 2 3</p>
                        <h4 class="mt-5 pt-4 fw-bold">Lower Elementary: Grades K-2 (ages 4-8)</h4>
                        <p>The early elementary grade levels lay an important foundation for learning. Students are
                            learning the basics of reading and math while exploring the world around them: animals,
                            habitats, patterns in nature, and history. This is also the best time to encourage
                            interaction with technology and collaboration with peers using purposeful, hands-on
                            activities that help young students understand subject matter while developing motor skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>Educational apps and 2-in-1s inspire learning in young children through touch, audio, text,
                            and video activities that draw attention to content with simple prompts and instructions.
                            Many apps now consist of immersive, kinesthetic activities and games—supported by
                            easy-to-use touch interfaces—that allows experiences comparable to those of books, games,
                            and other traditional materials.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Student device choices: 2-in-1s with touch or pen input allow students to collaborate
                                through exploration and investigation. Students can use them for one-to-one access,
                                pair, or small group collaboration, and/or classroom cart mobility.</li>
                            <li>Educator device choices: Mobile, full-featured 2-in-1s help teachers manage their
                                classrooms and communications efficiently, create and prepare curriculum and digital
                                content, and have a reliable connection to their personal learning communities and
                                access the school’s network, cloud, and LMSs from anywhere.</li>

                        <h4 class="mt-5 pt-4 fw-bold">Upper Elementary: Grades 3-5 (ages 8-12)</h4>
                        <p>In upper elementary grades, teachers incorporate a variety of teaching methods and students
                            increase mastery of basic knowledge and skills. As they start to build research skills and
                            expand their foundations, students need a supportive, encouraging, and friendly classroom
                            climate with focused, productive learning activities. Teachers may integrate digital
                            learning practices with a mix of teacher- and student-led activities where children take the
                            lead and explore educational apps together.</p>
                        <p>For this age group, technology is a useful tool to develop and catalog student portfolios,
                            monitor work, and provide feedback. The capability to connect a keyboard enables the device
                            to be integrated across subject areas and digital assessments as well. Diagnostic
                            applications and platforms allow for regular monitoring of student progress, collecting and
                            analyzing student data, and providing personalized instruction plans.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Student device choices: Laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in1s are the best devices for this
                                age group as they provide the mobility and performance to support students’ growing
                                proficiency for technology. They can collaborate with chat and video tools, research
                                topics on their own, and create dynamic presentations.</li>
                            <li>Educator device choices: Incorporating a virtual learning platform, interactive
                                whiteboards, and wireless devices improve classroom management. Teachers and parents can
                                monitor and guide students with a digital portfolio based on multiple resources or
                                applications. Teachers may personalize these portfolios based on each student’s level.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="mt-5 pt-4 fw-bold">High School: Grades 9-12 (ages 13-18)</h4>
                        <p>Secondary students spend most of their time cultivating college- and career-readiness skills
                            such as critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, communication, creativity, and
                            innovation. As technology innovation transforms the classroom, teachers and students can
                            significantly redesign their learning activities and will require high-end computing power
                            for STEM, parallel program operations, and design curriculum.</p>
                        <p>By this age, students should have developed firm technology skills and the ability to choose
                            which technologies they need for required tasks. They gain familiarity with online resources
                            and begin to use technology outside of the classroom for managing their personal and
                            professional lives. With a connected classroom, students can more easily find their
                            assignments and start working at their own pace, encouraging the personalization of their
                            learning experience and opening them to more opportunities beyond the basic curriculum.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Student device choices: The best device for this age group is a 2-in-1 or laptop that
                                provides desktop-like performance with mobile flexibility, a full-sized keyboard, and an
                                active stylus for easy annotating, drawing, or note taking. These devices are
                                lightweight, with flexible connectivity, and a long battery life, and they have
                                processor power for audio, video, graphics, and data processing.</li>
                            <li>Educator device choices: Laptops and integrated technologies such as an ecosystem of

                        <h4 class="mt-5 pt-4 fw-bold">Maker</h4>
                        <p>Maker education—closely associated with STEAM (science, technology, engineering, the arts,
                            and math) learning—is a way for children of all ages to tinker, construct, and create
                            together while solving problems through real experiences. With increased accessibility to
                            open-source software and hardware as well as other tools, educators, and students find it
                            easier to take part in the maker movement.</p>
                        <p>Maker spaces are creating new learning environments in schools, taking the place of these
                            more traditional programs such as metalworking, woodworking, home economics, and art, which
                            have all but vanished from formal education. The maker space enables independent and
                            group-based creativity and exploration, fueled by access to technology. Collaboration
                            through video conferencing, text messaging, communities of practice, or social media helps
                            students learn from and interact with experts beyond the classroom.</p>
                        <p>Maker education is not something set in stone by grade level or age. For students, it is more
                            about building foundational skills and expanding on these skills over time as they master
                            different techniques. For teachers, the biggest factor is safety—making sure students at
                            specific ages understand what they are doing and why, all in safe yet constructive ways.
                            Teachers of any subject or grade level can integrate maker concepts and activities and maker
                            spaces into their classrooms and schools just as students at any age—as long as they have
                            the correct skills—can be innovative makers.</p>
                        <h4 class="mt-5 pt-4 fw-bold">Beginners (early elementary, ages 5-8)</h4>
                        <p>Maker education for elementary school students focuses on foundational reasoning and
                            computational skills gained through basic, hands-on activities. Students learn to use the
                            physical tools needed to build, design, and innovate in the coming years while teachers
                            focus on helping them understand the process for why and how to do things with the correct
                            tools and strategy. Building support for future exploration, students engage in hands on
                            activities such as how to complete a circuit or logic-building games to build reasoning
                            insights. They may also build with construction toys or sculpt with clay or paper supplies
                            to learn more about how things fit and work together. Additionally, they may begin to thread
                            in artistic skills through sketching, coloring, and designing and explore math concepts of
                            angles and numbers through coding and design.</p>
                        <h4 class="mt-5 pt-4 fw-bold">Intermediate (upper elementary and middle school, ages 8-13)</h4>
                        <p>Once students have a firm foundation, these intermediate makers are now ready to further
                            develop diagnostic and problem-solving skills and engage in more complex activities.
                            Intermediate maker students will begin to learn how to use and integrate digital software
                            programs such as Scratch*, Blockly*, Turtle Art*, Inkscape*, and Tinker Cad* to enhance
                            their innovations. They will also use additional hardware tools such as laser cutters, 3D
                            printers, digital cameras, vinyl cutters, and needle and thread to explore many new projects
                            that enhance their creativity. Finally, students can begin to integrate electronics such as
                            microcontrollers, resistors, and small motors along with more analog materials like PVC
                            pipe, wood, metal, fabric, yarn, and cardboard to build skills in electronics, conductive
                            textiles and fabrication, design, and construction.</p>
                        <h4 class="mt-5 pt-4 fw-bold">Advanced (middle and high school, ages 13-18)</h4>
                        <p>Advanced makers have mastered the skills and have the agency and confidence to apply their
                            innovative process and skills to enhance their own learning. These students are ready to
                            build, create, hack, and innovate to address real-world problems. They can increase their
                            skill sets by using more complex software and hardware and running it by themselves or
                            teaching it to others.</p>
                        <h4 class="mt-5 pt-4 fw-bold">Teachers</h4>
                        <p>A successful maker teacher needs to be able to help students understand a problem so that the
                            student can create a solution. As there is no way that any one teacher can be a subject
                            matter expert in everything a maker student might need or want to know, teachers should
                            immerse themselves in the maker movement and attend professional development opportunities
                            and maker events to stay up to date and learn how to drive a creative and innovative
                            mindset. As their students gain maker skills, teachers will also need to keep up with
                            programming languages and programs like AutoCad*. With ongoing development, teachers can
                            integrate maker activities into their classrooms and curricula and build the skills to
                            advocate for more dedicated maker, innovation, and creativity spaces within the school.</p>
