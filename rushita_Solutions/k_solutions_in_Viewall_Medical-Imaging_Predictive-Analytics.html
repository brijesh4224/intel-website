                            unprecedented USD 18.3 trillion.<sup>1</sup> In response to these trends, payment models are

                        <p>Healthcare has become digitized, creating massive new data sets. These include electronic
                            medical record (EMR) systems, health claims data, radiology images, and lab results. In the
                            near future, genomics data will also grow significantly.</p>
                        <p>New data is also being generated by a growing number of medical <a
                                href="/content/www/us/en/healthcare-it/edge-analytics.html">devices at the edge</a>,
                            including patient wearables and monitors. Outside the clinical setting, patients are
                            generating quasi-health data through the use of personal wearable devices, fitness trackers,
                            and health applications.</p>
                        <p>By incorporating data from these sources, health providers can power new solutions in
                            predictive analytics for medical diagnosis, predictive modeling for health risks, and even
                            prescriptive analytics for precision medicine.</p>
                        <p>However, converting data into clinical results requires a foundation of hardware and software
                            designed to extract value from disparate data sets. One survey found that more than half of
                            health organizations do not have a comprehensive data governance plan in place.<sup>2</sup>
                            As a result, a significant portion of healthcare data remains untapped.</p>
                        <p>With a portfolio of technologies designed to efficiently move, store, and process data, power
                            big data platforms, and run AI models, Intel and our partners are working with health

                        <p>Predictive analytics has become a key piece of any health analytics strategy. Today, it’s a
                            critical tool for measuring, aggregating, and making sense of behavioral, psychosocial, and
                            biometric data that until recently was not available or exceedingly hard to capture.</p>
                        <p>At the individual level, predictive analytics can help health providers deliver the right
                            care to the right patient at the right time. On a larger scale, it can enable health systems
                            to identify and understand larger trends, leading to improved population health strategies.
                        </p>
                        <p>In one example, researchers developed a model of how Ebola is spread using big data analytics
                            and massive amounts of data, including information from social media and search engines.
                            Individuals who have potentially been exposed to Ebola can enter their symptoms into a
                            mobile app, which uses geocoordinates to check whether the person has been in proximity to
                            someone from a community in which Ebola has been active.<sup>3</sup></p>
                        <p>Not only can predictive analytics enhance care, but it can also dramatically reduce costs.
                            For example, more accurate prediction models for patient length of stay and readmission
                            rates enable hospitals to avoid penalties and reduce operational expenses. By tapping into
                            electronic health records (EHRs) and predictive analytics, providers can flag patients who
                            are likely to miss an appointment. Once identified, those patients could be reminded or
                            otherwise supported in keeping their appointment.</p>
                        <p>The enormous potential of predictive analytics includes helping identify patients at risk for
                            chronic conditions, developing evidence-based best practices, and proactively spotting
                            potential obstacles to care plan adherence. Data can help clinicians remain one step ahead
                            of events, delivering proactive care to patients before their health becomes critical.</p>

                        <h2 class="k_26px mt-5 fw-lighter pt-4">Examples of Predictive Analytics in Healthcare</h2>
                        <p>Today, health systems and providers are exploring different ways to use big data platforms
                            and AI for predictive analytics. These solutions are helping health organizations transition
                            from simply using data to learn what already happened to using that data to more reliably
                            forecast what will happen.</p>
                        <p><strong>Speeding Treatment of Critical Conditions</strong></p>
                        <p>Working with Intel, Penn Medicine created a collaborative data science platform to help
                            predict and prevent two of the most common and costly issues for hospitals: sepsis and heart
                            failure.</p>
                        <p>The predictive model was able to identify about 85 percent of sepsis cases (up from 50
                            percent) as much as 30 hours before the onset of septic shock (as opposed to two hours using
                            traditional methods).<sup>4</sup> It was also able to identify between 20 and 30 percent of
                            heart failure patients who had not been properly identified.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;These efforts
                            empowered clinicians to deliver treatment sooner, speed time to recovery, and save resources
                            for the hospital.</p>
                        <div class="my-5">
                            <img src="../img/rushita_img/medicine1.png" alt="" width="100%">
                        </div>
                        <p><strong>Predicting Length of Stay</strong></p>
                        <p>Intel and Cloudera helped a large hospital group use predictive analytics to provide enhanced
                            accuracy in predicting length of stay. The big data platform based on <a
                                href="/content/www/us/en/products/details/processors/xeon.html">Intel® Xeon®
                                processor</a> clusters allowed the hospital group to ingest unrelated, unstructured, and
                            semistructured data.</p>
                        <p>With the ability to plan and staff more efficiently, the hospital group saved USD 120 million
                            in annual costs (about USD 12,000 per patient) and boosted facility utilization by 5
                            percent, allowing hospitals to potentially serve an extra 10,000 patients
                            annually.<sup>5</sup></p>
                        <p><strong>Reducing Readmissions</strong></p>
                        <p>In another effort, Intel and Cloudera used socioeconomic data, EHRs, and predictive analytics
                            to help a hospital group identify patients with a high readmission risk at the time of
                            diagnosis. Hospital staff could then provide additional medical care to reduce readmission
                            rates.</p>
                        <p>The big data platform, powered by Intel® Xeon® processors, has enabled the hospital group to
                            reduce 6,000 occurrences of patient readmission, avoid USD 4 million in potential Medicare
                            penalties, and save about USD 72 million annually in medical service costs.<sup>6</sup></p>

                        <p><strong>Identifying Patients at Risk of Decline</strong></p>
                        <p>Sharp HealthCare used technologies from Intel and Cloudera to successfully deploy a
                            predictive clinical analytics model. The model used machine learning and data from the
                            hospitals’ EMR system to identify patients at risk of needing an intervention from the rapid
                            response team in the next hour.</p>
                        <p>The model was 80 percent accurate in predicting the likelihood of an event within an
                            hour.<sup>7</sup> This empowered rapid response teams to intervene proactively, improve the
                            quality and cost of care, and enhance resource utilization.</p>

                        <p>By providing a foundation of technology for AI and big data platforms, Intel and our
