                        </div>
                        <p>Despite ongoing efforts, several obstacles continue to impede the advancement of digital
                            learning experiences on a global scale. These include limited internet infrastructure
                            coverage, inadequate device access, and a skillset gap among educators, hindering the
                            seamless progression of digital learning experiences.</p>
                        <p>Overcoming these challenges needs a digital solution that can go beyond the scope of the
                            usual server-based digital libraries and broadband connectivity. For the 5G Digital School
                            Library project in Penang, Intel helped its collaborators and the state government create a
                            unique on-premise edge solution. The pillars of this digital solution are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The latest 5G and cloud technologies</li>
                            <li>Ease of access</li>
                            <li>Simplicity of use and management</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Many educational solutions currently utilize cloud-based platforms and repositories as the
                            central hub for distributing learning materials and content to end-user devices, such as
                            student devices, teacher laptops, or interactive smart boards, via the Internet. However,
                            this cloud-centric model is not without its drawbacks. The reliance on a cloud-only
                            infrastructure often overlooks several critical factors:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Bandwidth limitations:</b>Not all locations have access to high-speed internet, which
                                can hinder the distribution of content.</li>
                            <li><b>Network reliability:</b>The possibility of network outages can disrupt access to
                                learning materials.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The 5G Digital School Library solution adopts a hybrid platform approach to address these
                            limitations and here’s how it differentiates itself:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>
                                    Content storage flexibility:</b>Learning resources and content are stored both at
                                the edge (locally) and in the cloud. The decision of where to store depends on factors
                                such as content sensitivity and the need for high availability.</li>
                            <li><b>Pre-caching for high availability:</b>By pre-caching content at the edge, the
                                solution ensures that materials are available even during periods of limited or no
                                internet connectivity.</li>
                            <li><b>Ease of content management and platform:</b>The hybrid model solution here also
                                simplifies the management of learning content, making it more accessible to users
                                regardless of their technical expertise for ease of adoption. It also allows pre-cached
                                content access locally and remotely.</li>
                        </ul>

                                Penang.</i></p>
                        <p>Figure 1 depicts the architecture of the 5G Digital School Library. This initiative is made
                            possible by a collaborative ecosystem comprised of Intel, Penang Science Cluster, 88
                            Captains, and other stakeholders who share a common goal: enhancing the learning experience
                            for Penang’s students through the use of advanced technology. This goal would be
                            accomplished through an on-site edge computing solution that includes a server for content
                            access and multiple edge devices for each school. The content access server facilitates
                            content caching and provides uninterrupted access to teachers and students.</p>
                        <p>Here's an overview of the solution:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The on-premise edge solution centers on a Content Access Server (CAS), which maintains a
                                5G connection to a variety of online educational platforms and internet-based
                                educational resources. Additionally, the CAS functions as a local centralized hub for
                                students and teachers to access pre-cached learning materials locally and remotely.</li>
                            <li>This hybrid approach, utilizing 5G technology, effectively addresses challenges related
                                to bandwidth and internet connectivity, which are common barriers to delivering digital
                                education in remote and underserved areas. By harnessing the power of 5G, these areas
                                can bypass the limitations of traditional fiber optic infrastructure in underserved
                                areas and access educational content from the CAS, even in the absence of an internet
                                connection.</li>
                            <li>The students' and teachers’ devices used in this setup are computers equipped with
                                high-performance processors that enable the running of a wide array of educational
                                applications and tasks.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Taking A Student-Centric Approach to the On-Premise Edge Solution</h3>
                        <p>Since the solution was aimed at a relatively younger audience, Penang Science Cluster, the
                            implementer of this solution, sought out stakeholders with empathy and drive to improve
                            lives through cutting-edge, user-centric technology. Hence, Intel Malaysia was selected as a
                            technical consultant for this initiative.</p>
                        <p>88 Captains, a non-profit and N50 partner that works for the advancement of Malaysia’s
                            students, also brought together leading organizations such as SNS Network Technology Bhd.,
                            and Yes by YTL Communications Sdn. Bhd., as well as OCBC Bank, a leading Malaysian financial
                            institution.</p>
                        <p>The technical stakeholders, including Intel Malaysia, had a background in providing
                            innovative solutions spanning 5G, Cloud, Edge, and high-speed computing at scale that
                            provided ease of access and use to the end users.</p>
                        <p>To kick off the project, 88 Captains and JPNPP (Jabatan Pendidikan Negeri Pulau Pinang), the
                            Penang State Education Department1 identified 88 pioneer schools across Penang. Each of the
                            selected schools would be provided with a start-up kit comprising a high-powered,
                            enterprise-grade 5G modem, a Content Access Server (CAS), which can store up to several
                            thousand ebooks, and 3 new laptops. This would enable every student to freely access their
                            school’s own Digital Library anytime and anywhere without being constrained by the
                            limitations of traditional classroom learning.</p>

                        <h3>Empowering Education in Penang and Beyond</h3>
                        <p>The 5G Digital School Library Program and the on-premise edge solution have ushered in a new
                            era of digitally-enabled learning. The solution has not only made a tangible impact on
                            students’ learning experiences in Penang but has also advanced Malaysia’s educational and
                            learning infrastructure.</p>
                        <p>The implementation of the on-premise edge solution ensured that students gained uninterrupted
                            access to a wealth of educational resources. It has addressed the limitations of traditional
                            physical libraries and allowed students to learn at their own pace, anytime and anywhere.
                            Thanks to its success at scale, similar libraries shall be set up for students across other
                            states in Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>Of the 88 schools surveyed, all reported positive experiences and would recommend Yes 5G to
                            other schools. The survey highlights exceptional performance in speed and service/support,
                            reflecting high overall satisfaction. The impressive performance of Yes 5G services has
                            enabled the schools to fully utilize the Internet, facilitating enhanced teaching and
                            ensuring equitable internet access for all students. This underscores YTL Communications'
                            commitment to advancing digital education experiences.</p>
                        <p>To date, the 5G Digital School Library Program successfully enabled ~50% of Penang’s rural
                            schools3 with internet access. In doing so, it has enabled almost 200,000 K-12 students4 to
                            access updated knowledge and expand their horizons. Above all, this solution isn’t just
                            about providing students with a digital mode of learning, instead, it is more about bringing
                            them on par with the rest of the world in terms of digital literacy, digital accessibility,
                            and opportunities for upskilling and personal development. Spurred on by the success of this
                            project, the government of Malaysia has also sped up the deployment and rollout of 5G
                            infrastructure across Penang. In collaboration with Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB), an
                            undertaking from the Ministry of Finance, the Penang State Government is committed to
                            ensuring 80% of 5G network coverage across Penang by the end of 2023. <sup>5</sup></p>
                        <p>These steps tie into the Malaysian government’s strategic initiative to upgrade its digital
                            infrastructure and groom home-grown digital talent. In doing so, it will stay in step with
                            the rest of the Asia-Pacific and Japan region, which is emerging as a global powerhouse for
                            digital transformation initiatives.</p>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>Beyond the numbers, this collaboration reflects a shared long-term vision for education.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the deployment of this solution and its continued efforts and commitment to
                            reduce the digital gap among students in Malaysia, 88 Captains was recently invited to
                            become a partner organization of N50, an international NGO dedicated to empowering
                            disadvantaged communities across the globe to gain access to the digital world.</p>
                        <p>Intel’s commitment to such collaborations and forward-thinking technology solutions
                            demonstrates a dedication to shaping the future of education. Collaborations such as these
                            stand out as a compelling example of how efforts among solution providers, technology
                            manufacturers, and local organizations can effectively bridge the digital divide in
                            education and significantly improve students’ learning experiences.</p>
