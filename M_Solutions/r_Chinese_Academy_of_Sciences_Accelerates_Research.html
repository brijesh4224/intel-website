                        <p>Traditional materials research methods are gradually becoming a major bottleneck in the
                            development of innovative industrial products and quality improvements due to the long R&D
                            cycle and unpredictable success rates. To accelerate new materials research and strengthen
                            nation-level industrial competitiveness, the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of
                            Sciences (IOP-CAS), starts to rely more heavily on high-throughput computing (HTC), an
                            emerging branch of high-performance computing (HPC). They have built a high-throughput
                            materials genome computation and data processing platform to support the work on the
                            Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) project, and provided data sharing services for more
                            materials researchers across the country with the materials genome database and the
                            cloud-based resources platform.</p>
                        <p>Different from conventional HPC, where the pursuit of faster speed and higher efficiency of
                            individual computation tasks made “faster calculation” the key metric, HTC, a new type of
                            data-augmented HPC technology, is focused on the ability to perform “more calculations.” In
                            other words, HTC focuses on improving task parallelism and throughput for massive data
                            processing. For this reason, HTC platforms tend to have higher or more demanding
                            requirements for parallel processing performance, average response time, throughout,
                            scalability, and cost.</p>
                        <p>To meet these practical requirements, IOP-CAS works with Intel, an innovator in core
                            computing power, and Dell, a provider of servers, storage devices and solutions, to build a
                            next-generation materials genome computation and data processing platform (the New

                            storage devices and solutions, which incorporate Dell’s unique innovative capabilities and
                            features. In addition to higher materials genome computational efficiency, the New Platform
                            also provides a comprehensive shared materials genome database for a broad community of
                            materials researchers.</p>

                        <p>If crude oil is the lifeblood of modern industry, then materials are its bones and muscles.
                            Any attempt to make industrial products more competitive requires a continued process of
                            “transmutation.” This means continuous R&D and introduction of new materials are inevitable.
                            In the past, materials researchers mainly used the trial and error approach to study the
                            structural characterization of different materials in order to discover the nature of new
                            materials. However, as the composition of modern materials becomes more and more complex,
                            especially with the emergence of composite materials, conventional experimental techniques
                            no longer work in many circumstances. Issues such as long R&D cycles, high costs, and low
                            success rates have become increasingly pronounced.</p>
                        <p>The launch of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI)1 on a global scale and the growing
                            maturity of theoretical simulation methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) and the
                            Monte Carlo Methods brings materials researchers breaking points. They are now more often
                            leveraging strong parallel computing power from computer methods, HTC in particular, to
                            screen materials in the way of simulating calculation.</p>
                        <p>Take high-profile semiconductor materials research as an example, the application and
                            performance of each new material, such as the growth behavior of thin films on a substrate
                            and whether there were deactivation or surface reconstruction, all required repeated testing
                            and verification in the past. Today, with the DFT theory, researchers can use partially
                            known density functional calculations to fit the total energy of the system and use methods
                            of quantum mechanics to precisely calculate electron-electron interaction between atoms in a
                            material to obtain data on the electronic structure, magnetism, and structural stability of
                            more compounds, theoretically guiding material design and accelerating the application of
                            more new materials to semiconductors.</p>
                        <p>As one of the top institutes for materials science research and application in China, IOP-CAS
                            is staying abreast of the latest developments and is committed to applying HTC to the
                            research of new materials. The results have been very encouraging with many breakthroughs in
                            superconductor, nano, and power battery materials. IOP-CAS believes that one of key missions
                            to accelerate new materials research in China is to continue incorporating the latest
                            developments in Information Technology into materials research and build a comprehensive
                            materials genome data platform with greater and more efficient computing power. This will
                            help researchers focus more on the materials research itself instead of dealing with
                            sophisticated procurement for and construction of such a computing environment.</p>
                        <p>IOP-CAS has worked with Intel and Dell to build a solid IT infrastructure foundation for the
                            next-generation high-throughput materials computation and data processing platform. By
                            introducing advanced computing and interconnect technologies, along with mature data
                            processing/storage products and solutions, the platform is a powerful engine in China’s
                            materials genome computation and research.</p>

                            Solution</h2>
                        <p>As mentioned above, the HTC solution plays a key role in IOP-CAS' New Platform. To put it
                            simply, it is a computation system with the ability to process large volumes of independent
                            tasks in parallel. The following features distinguish it from conventional HPC solutions:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Processing: </b>Tasks are generally processed with thread-level parallelism and
                                workloads constantly change to the task requirements;</li>
                            <li><b>Efficiency: </b>It is more focused on the integration of data with computation and
                                the read/write performance has a direct impact on system efficiency;</li>
                            <li><b>Performance:</b>It is more focused on increasing concurrent computation and data
                                processing requests within a unit of time;</li>
                            <li><b>Cost:</b>There is positive correlation between system processing capability and
                                thread counts, and prioritization of single-thread cost improves overall processing
                                performance.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In general, HTC that can process large volumes of workloads is well suited to scenarios that
                            involve the screening of numerous samples, for example, the R&D process in biology and
                            pharmaceuticals etc. HTC can also be used in simulating calculation and screening massive
                            materials genomes during materials genome research.</p>
                        <p>As shown in Figure 1, materials genome computation can often be simply divided into the
                            following steps:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The system selects data from an external materials genome database and generates a file
                                that can be called by specific simulation software (such as VASP2);</li>
                            <li>Then, with high-performance parallel computing, it obtains data about corresponding
                                material properties such as energy density, electronic structure, and energy
                                increase/decrease in synthesis;</li>
                            <li>The computation results are kept in the internal storage system for further analysis. A
                                high-performance parallel distributed file system is usually needed;</li>
                            <li>Once the data has been post-processed and integrated, further in-depth analysis can be
                                performed with the results being used for materials screening. The analysis results can
                                also be imported to the materials genome database. Thus, a complete procedural
                                computation process is formed.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>The generation of structure files, theoretical simulation and computation, and analysis of
                            calculation results in the processes above can be converted into a set of independent
                            instructions and tasks in a certain way. These instructions and tasks can be executed by
                            specific software packages, which provides the perfect scenario for HTC applications.</p>
                        <p>In addition to executing high-throughput materials genome computation tasks, IOP-CAS is
                            planning to build a data center for the New Platform to store calculated data for subsequent
                            analysis. It is also going to provide a shared data platform in a private cloud to share
                            data, codes, and computing tools used during materials genome computation. This will enable
                            more materials researchers across the country to focus on their research instead of having
                            to spend time, effort, and money in procuring the same type of equipment and set up a
                            similar environment.</p>
                        <p>With all these ideas, IOP-CAS plans to deploy its high-throughput materials genome
                            computation solution through four key software packages: the first is the high-throughput
                            dispatching package based on Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (Slurm). It will
                            ensure optimal execution performance through the dispatch and monitoring of all
                            computational and analytical tasks; the second is the data archiving package, which can
                            perform high-speed archiving of calculation results in the Lustre parallel distributed file
                            system; the third is the postprocessing package that performs inference and integration of
                            the raw calculation results for subsequent data analysis or for graphical displays/queries;
                            and the fourth is the big data analysis package, which helps researchers utilize artificial
                            intelligence (AI) and other technologies to screen new materials and predict synthesis
                            outcomes more efficiently with a massive volume of calculated data and analysis results.</p>
                        <p>Excellent design ideas require the support of appropriate hardware infrastructure. This
                            represents no small challenge to IOP-CAS that is more focused on materials research and
                            lacks IT expertise and experience. To better unleash the potential of the New Platform and
                            maximize its performance in future computation tasks, IOP-CAS decided to “leave it to the
                            experts” by bringing in Intel and Dell as its innovation partners. They joined hands in
                            developing a high-performance and high-availability compute and storage hardware
                            architecture tailored to its needs based on the comprehensive software framework above.
                            IOP-CAS raised several requirements for the New Platform’s infrastructure before the three
                            parties commenced their work:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Advanced Technology:</b>
                                The compute and storage hardware architecture of the New Platform must be able to
                                support continued increases in high-throughput materials genome computation tasks over
                                the coming years while maintaining a performance advantage;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Operational Stability:</b>
                                Once the New Platform has been built, it will need to handle massive high-throughput
                                materials genome computation tasks. Any system failure will incur unpredictable losses,
                                making the reliability and stability of the architecture incredibly important;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Simple Operations and Maintenance (O&M):</b>
                                IOP-CAS’s relative lack of human resources means that no dedicated O&M experts can be
                                assigned to the platform, so the O&M of the compute and storage hardware architecture
                                must be agile and easy.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Intel® Xeon® Processors Delivering More Computing Power and
                            Optimal Parallelism at the Same Cost</h2>
                        <p>Incorporating advanced computing technology into the New Platform was IOP-CAS’s foremost
                            requirement. That is, its requirement for computing power or performance must be met.</p>
                        <p>The computing power of the New Platform mainly comes from processors, so choosing an
                            appropriate primary processor that could satisfy the high-throughput materials genome
                            computation requirements of IOP-CAS was a top priority in the construction of the platform.
                            It needs to be considered thoroughly and balanced across multiple dimensions. To be
                            specific, as HTC is more focused on parallel processing which requires the computation
                            system to simultaneously process as many tasks as possible, and features a positive
                            correlation to thread counts, the number of cores and threads in the processor was the
                            foremost consideration. Secondly, the L3 cache (last-level cache) is shared by all cores and
                            threads in a processor, so a larger size of L3 cache needed to be considered to ensure more
                            caches were allocated to each parallel task, increasing the cache hit ratio. Thirdly, a
                            higher processor clock speed is essential to increase the processing speed of individual
                            tasks. Finally, prices or costs also had to be considered. Processors with higher
                            configurations may be better at meeting the above specifications and metrics, but they also
                            increase the cost. A more appropriate choice would be to maximize the return on capital
                            expenditure (CapEx) without compromising parallel processing performance. As such, the
                            principle of prioritizing single-thread cost must be followed.</p>
                        <p>To help IOP-CAS select a higher-affordability processor, Intel worked with experts at the
                            institute to conduct thorough tests and assessment of several Intel® processors. The <a
                                href="">Intel®
                                Xeon® Gold 6230 processor</a> was IOP-CAS’s initial consideration. However, new plans
                            that
                            required the New Platform to undertake much more computations in the future led IOP-CAS to
                            switch to the <a href="">Intel® Xeon® Gold 6248 processor</a> with a higher clock speed. But
                            after helping
                            IOP-CAS conduct thorough tests, Intel made the following suggestion: Though the higher clock
                            speed of the Intel® Xeon® Gold 6248 processor could enhance performance in some areas, it
                            had the same number of cores and threads as the Intel® Xeon® Gold 6230 processor, so this
                            enhancement did not offer a breakthrough in performance. With careful evaluation of the
                            upgraded SKUs of the 2nd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processor family released at the start of
                            2020, Intel suggested IOP-CAS choose the Intel® Xeon® Gold 6230R processor.</p>
                        <p>The upgraded SKUs in 2020 are all enhanced in Turbo, core/thread count and cache size
                            compared to the 2nd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors released in 2019. Take the
                            <a href="">Intel® Xeon® Gold 6230R processor</a> as an example, its core counts, thread
                            counts, and cache size are
                            all 30% bigger than the previous model (Intel® Xeon® Gold 6230 processor), and its Turbo
                            frequency is increased from 3.9 GHz to 4.0 GHz, as shown in Table 1, while the cost
                            remains
                            roughly the same.4 It means this choice would significantly improve the CapEx returns of
                            the
                            New Platform.

                            began looking into how to enhance the integration of computation and data. This is exactly
                            what the HTC technology means for “data augmented,” and cares besides parallel computing
                            power—it has more demanding requirements for throughput, latency, and bandwidth of storage
                            modules.</p>
                        <p>As such, Intel and Dell chose to introduce advanced software/hardware products and

                            storage, data analysis, and visualization, the hardware architecture of the New Platform is
                            divided into two platforms—one for high-throughput materials genome computation, and one for
                            materials genome data processing. The former is primarily responsible for HTC tasks and
                            high-speed file storage in the calculation process, while the latter provides data storage,
                            analysis, and cloud-based sharing. A 10 Gbps production network is used to connect the two

                        <p>In the process of high-throughput materials genome computation, hundreds of thousands of
                            parallel and independent computation tasks generate large amounts of process files. These

                            end, the New Platform utilizes the high-performance Lustre parallel file system built on two
                            Dell EMC PowerVault ME4084 High-Density Storage devices (2*84*8 TB, for a total capacity of
                            1344 TB) based on Intel processor architecture. The Lustre file system supports data storage
                            in hundreds of PBs and concurrent bandwidth in TBs, and offers high scalability, so IOP-CAS
                            can upgrade the ME4 Series Storage devices flexibly and easily as necessary.</p>
                        <p>Materials genome computation produces large amounts of unstructured data. Take electronic
                            structure (electron density) as an example, the electron density file of a single material
                            could be a single image, up to 10 GB in size. The New Platform must therefore provide a
                            high-performance and scalable storage system for massive outcome data. Dell’s solution was
                            the Dell EMC Isilon Series Scalable NAS Storage devices, known for outstanding efficiency
                            and excellent scalability. Four Isilon H400, a hybrid scale-out NAS system, and eight A2000
                            Isilon, a scale-out NAS system for archive data storage, were used to develop a unified
                            multi-tier storage resource pool for data analysis and secure data storage respectively.
                            Both products offer excellent scale-out capability and can help the platform expand storage
                            capacity flexibly. Their built-in OneFS operating system provides up to 80% of storage
                            utilization, and a variety of data protection and security measures to ensure the safety and
                            reliability of platform data.6 This also satisfies IOP-CAS’s requirements for stability and
                            reliability of the New Platform infrastructure.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, Dell also provided the New Platform with six Dell EMC VxRail hyper-converged
                            appliances to develop a cloud-based resource pool for resource sharing. As mentioned above,
                            one of the objectives for the New Platform is to share outcome data, codes, and computation
                            tools used during materials genome computation to help improve the efficiency of more
                            researchers in the field of materials. VxRail Hyper-converged Infrastructure can be fully
                            integrated into Dell's Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) software system. This makes it
                            easy for the platform to deploy a cloud environment based on VMware Cloud Foundation using
                            VxRail hyper-converged appliances. The advantage of such a fully-integrated platform is: it
                            greatly simplifies the complex process of setting up a private cloud from planning, to
                            construction and deployment. The complexity of subsequent O&M is also greatly reduced,
                            providing IOP-CAS with an all-in-one cloud solution.</p>
                        <p>To ensure that storage devices and compute nodes work together more efficiently, Cornelis
                            Networks products was used on the New Platform to improve interconnect efficiency and
                            scalability. Cornelis Networks products optimizes data stream management and enhances
                            protection of packet integrity to further reduce latency through technological innovations
                            at the link layer. More importantly, the Cornelis Networks products-based switch chip
                            supports up to 48 ports, allowing the New Platform to support up to 1152 ports with just one
                            single switch. This exceptional scalability satisfies IOP-CAS’s requirements for future
                            upgrades and expansions of the New Platform.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;" class="fw-lighter">Outcome and Prospects</h2>
                        <p>Through its three-way partnership with Intel and Dell, IOP-CAS has now deployed 160 Intel®
                            Xeon® Gold 6230R processor nodes and 20 high-performance Intel® Xeon® Platinum 9242
                            processor nodes on its new high-throughput materials genome computation platform. A
                            complete, unified, and multi-tier storage resource pool and a cloud-based data platform for
                            resource sharing have also been set up in the data center where the materials genome data
                            processing platform is located.</p>
                        <p>Once all the above nodes are put in service, around 3,000 DFT-based tasks can be executed and
                            100-700 (depending on material complexity) calculations for inorganic crystalline materials
                            genomes will be completed on a daily basis. All inorganic crystalline materials known to
                            mankind (around 100,000 after deduplication) could be analyzed within a single year. In the
                            next 3-5 years, IOPCAS will use the computing power from the New Platform to continue
                            exploring materials not yet known to mankind and incorporate the prediction data for 500,000
                            unknown materials into the platform’s materials database.7 This serves to transform the
                            materials research approach from conventional “discover-calculate” to “calculate-discover,”
                            converting Information Technology into a driver of new materials research.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the acceleration of materials research, the New Platform will provide support
                            for the integration of industry, universities, and scientific research institutes. The
                            cloud-based shared resource pool will allow students, teachers, and researchers from
                            universities, scientific research institutes, or businesses to utilize existing materials
                            genome data on the data platform to conduct new materials synthesis quickly, avoiding the
                            waste of resources caused by duplicate calculation. Moreover, with rich data accumulated on
                            the data platform, IOP-CAS is able to visualize the internal structures of various inorganic
                            crystalline materials to teachers and students in a variety of ways. Virtual Reality (VR)
                            technology could even be introduced to make the study and research of materials “tangible.”
                        </p>
                        <p>Looking forward, IOP-CAS also plans to work with its IT partners such as Intel and Dell on
                            further optimization and expansion of the materials genome computation platform, so that HTC
                            nodes will be increased to around 500, and computing power be doubled,7 making IOP-CAS’s
                            materials genome data platform one of the best in the world. The computing focus of the New
                            Platform will also be expanded from inorganic crystalline materials to molecular materials.
                            The scope for new materials research will continue to broaden. Intel and Dell will leverage
                            their own strengths and help IOP-CAS make more achievements in materials genome computation
                            with their evolving products, technologies and solutions.</p>
