                        <p>Teams all over the world have been building models to organize and interpret content for
                            decades. AI is the latest application for these models and has, in the past three years,
                            advanced at a rate that would have been difficult for anyone to fathom—including the
                            researchers who are immersed in it on a daily basis. In 2023, industry produced 51 notable
                            machine learning models, and academia contributed 15.1
                        </p>
                        <p>AI researchers are charged with harnessing vast quantities of data, text, images, and video
                            and building constructs that bring order to them—what we call multimodal foundational
                            models. Beyond warehousing and categorizing information, researchers are creating new ways
                            for people to interact with content, such as a chatbot querying a video to glean details,
                            thus saving a user the time of viewing the full clip.</p>
                        <p>As foundational models become more fully featured—and as they move from research to
                            production, where billions of people are using them—it’s crucial that they minimize biases
                            that can lead to unfair outcomes and perpetuate existing inequalities.2 Researchers probing
                            for intersectional social biases found that existing models contained a number of them
                            related to gender, race, and other social attributes.</p>
                        <p>The challenge for researchers is how to create a benchmark to prove biases in the models and,
                            subsequently, how to create methods to reduce those biases. As AI gains widespread
                            acceptance in the commercial market, time is of the essence for addressing these challenges.

                        <p>Enter the counterfactual. Simply put, counterfactual inquiries use “if only” or “what if”
                            reasoning to imagine alternative outcomes for past events. Put another way, they consider
                            how the world would have to be different for a desirable outcome to occur. Most of us know,
                            for instance, that pushing a glass bowl from a table results in the bowl breaking. The
                            counterfactual would be that if the bowl were pushed onto a pile of pillows—or a carpeted
                            surface—it would not break. </p>
                        <p>Counterfactuals originated in cognitive behavioral science and predate AI. When applied to
                            AI, they explain what would have to be different in the input to change the outcome of an AI
                            system. They help with understanding. And, it turns out, they’re pivotal to removing bias.

                            constructed a dataset using images where intersectional social attributes were varied,”

                                Labs</a>. “This let

                        <p>Diverse teams are better equipped to recognize and eliminate biases. Intel’s Cognitive AI
                            Group reflects that diversity: They are highly distributed around the world, 30 percent of

                        <p>Lal and his team used Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a common technique for enhancing
                            the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models, which couples large foundational
                            models with external memory hosted in large vector stores or vector databases. Their social
                            counterfactuals dataset consists of synthetic images constructed using diffusion models. The

                        <p>“Unless the models are probed using data-intensive methods, it’s difficult to know what
                            biases might be present. As we constructed this dataset, we studied six foundational models.
                            We found a lot of biases. Some models were more biased than others, which shows how
                            important it is to probe each foundational model,” Lal continued.</p>

                            2 AI accelerators. Models are trained on internet-scale data, and training throughput can be
                            very high as models are scaled up to hundreds of AI accelerators. Working closely with the
                            AI developer community is vital.

                        <P>Training foundational models requires hundreds—or even thousands—of AI accelerators. The
                            Intel Labs team relies heavily on Intel Gaudi accelerator-based AI clusters. Third-party
                            studies by <a href="" style="color: #0068B5; text-decoration: underline !important;text-underline-offset: .3rem !important;">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a> have verified the high scaling
                            efficiency of Intel
                            Gaudi accelerators as the number of Intel Gaudi AI accelerators is scaled up for distributed
                            training. When Intel Labs teamed up with Hugging Face to <a href="" style="color: #0068B5; text-decoration: underline !important;text-underline-offset: .3rem !important;">compare Intel Gaudi 2 AI
                                accelerators with both Nvidia A100 and Nvidia H100</a>, the head-to-head tests showed
                            that Intel
                            Gaudi 2 with Optimum Habana is about 1.4x faster than Nvidia H100 and 2.5x faster than
                            Nvidia A100 80 GB with transformers.</P>
                        <P>The solution’s infrastructure, designed with security in mind, operates on-premise. Servers

                            control. <a href=""

                        <p>If a municipality requires additional security measures, server infrastructure can adjust to
                            meet these needs. With compliant security, even an administrator cannot access personal

                        <p>Development support from Intel helps AI Sweden maximize hardware capabilities, make
                            software-based adjustments, and assist with preliminary testing on evaluation datasets. The

                            now handle tasks like creating documents, improving written language, or filling out
                            applications. Because municipalities employ a diverse workforce, and not all are fluent in
                            Swedish, the solution also manages content and queries in English. Plans include support for

                        </div>
                        <p>AI Sweden and the associated municipalities will scope multiple use cases as the
                            proof-of-concept system demonstrates its potential. For example, if a government official
                            needs to make a critical decision, the digital assistant can help summarize the most
                            relevant background information.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Results</h2>
                        <p>While the prototype digital assistant remains under development, the initial results show
                            great promise. Early testing and anecdotal feedback indicate the solution remains on track
                            to meet its goals. Government employees testing the system found benefits like time savings
                            and more accurate results with text-related tasks.</p>
                        <p>A worker shortage in Sweden can make a digital assistant especially valuable to the country.
                            For example, with generative AI taking over time-consuming and repetitive tasks in
                            government facilities, employees can allocate more time to job activities that require human
                            expertise and interaction.</p>
                        <p>The digital assistant can also adapt to support smaller public organizations with fewer
                            resources, smaller budgets, and less specialized knowledge. AI Sweden plans to expand the
                            testing process to a thousand users in the near future. Over time, the digital assistant
                            could inspire other nations seeking to tap AI’s potential in government settings.</p>
                        <p>The virtual assistant supports Sweden’s goals of maintaining digital sovereignty and making
                            technology investments that could make public employees’ jobs easier and more efficient. The
                            solution also supports Sweden’s democratic ideals for transparency, integrity, and
                            opportunity for greater representation.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Key Takeaways</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A collaboration between AI Sweden and governmental municipalities led to a prototype
                                digital assistant that can assist government staff with repetitive tasks, allowing them
                                to focus on the more interpersonal aspects of their jobs.</li>
                            <li>Intel Xeon processors and Intel Gaudi 2 accelerators underlie the prototype’s
                                architecture and provide the needed security features, scalability, and performance.
                            </li>
                            <li>Making RAG solutions valuable to users requires significant fine-tuning. With the help
                                of staff-annotated content, the digital assistant can respond to queries with more
                                applicable and accurate information.</li>
                            <li>AI Sweden designed the prototype to meet European data privacy requirements like GDPR
                                and Sweden’s countrywide mandates. A combination of secure memory enclaves, encrypted
                                storage, and Intel TDX provided a foundation for multi-layered security.</li>
                            <li>AI Sweden’s experience building and testing the proof-of-concept system can serve as a
                                template for other countries wishing to implement a similar solution.</li>
