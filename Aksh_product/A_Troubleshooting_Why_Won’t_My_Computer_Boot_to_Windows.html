                                        you’re putting a build together or your system suddenly stopped working, knowing
                                        where to start fixing a computer can be difficult. This difficulty is compounded
                                        if you can’t access your operating system.</p>

                                    <p class="V_pv">WIn this guide, we’ll be covering steps to take if your computer is
                                        turning on and your display is working, but it’s not allowing you access to your
                                        operating system (OS) and is stuck on the BIOS screen. There are many potential
                                        causes for this problem, so we’ll be walking through some of the more common
                                        issues to try and get your system back up and running.</p>

                                                <p class="V_pv">BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), is software stored on
                                                    your motherboard that allows it to interact with the system hardware
                                                    and control basic functions like boot priority. Newer motherboards
                                                    use UEFI instead of BIOS. UEFI is an improved version of the
                                                    software designed to be more user-friendly and ensure compatibility
                                                    with newer hardware.</p>
                                                <p class="V_pv">Think of it as a simple operating system for your
                                                    motherboard that tells the computer how to start. The BIOS is what
                                                    you see before your operating system loads, and usually consists of
                                                    a text menu or a simple interface that allows you to control the
                                                    basics of your hardware. This includes modifying startup
                                                    instructions and troubleshooting.</p>
                                                <p class="V_pv">BIOS can vary between motherboards, so there aren’t
                                                    universal instructions for operation. Though the interfaces vary by

                                            that OS can be indicative of a problem with the drive. There are a few ways
                                            to diagnose storage issues. We’re going to start with the boot order.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">The boot order, or boot priority, is the order in which your PC
                                            scans available storage options and decides which ones to prioritize. If the
                                            OS drive isn’t the highest in the boot order, this could explain why it
                                            isn’t properly loading. Adjusting these settings allows you to boot from a
                                            disc or external storage, which can be useful for something like the BIOS
                                            update mentioned above. This can also cause problems if the boot priority is
                                            incorrect, or if your system is not detecting the primary storage device.

                                            should be the
                                            one with your OS installed. If you don’t know which drive to boot from, you
                                            may need to look at the drive itself, as the capacity and brand is often
                                            evident on the label, and this information is often referenced within the
                                            BIOS as well. If you aren’t sure which of your drives has the OS, disable
                                            all but one drive in the BIOS, and see if the system boots. If it doesn’t,
                                            continue the process of elimination until you’ve found the correct drive.
                                            You can then go back into BIOS and re-enable the other storage drives. Just
                                            be sure the drive with your OS is at the top of the priority list.</p>

                                            save changes and exit.</p>

                                            be looking at an issue with the drive itself or how it is configured.

                                    </p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">Before doing so, be sure to unplug your power cable, ensure you know
                                        the safest way to open your case, and keep in mind if working on a pre-built
                                        system that you could be potentially violating your warranty. Check with the
                                        manufacturer of your system if that’s a concern.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">Once your system is open, check that the cables attached to your
                                        storage drive are properly connected and aren’t loose. If you’re using an M.2
                                        drive, check that it is properly seated in the correct slot on your motherboard.

                                    <p class="V_pv">If everything looks fine, it might be time to remove your storage
                                        and test it with another system that you know works. If you can install the
                                        drive into another functional system for testing purposes, that would be ideal.
                                        If not, there are USB adapters that will allow you to plug the drive into the
                                        USB port of another system to check to see if the drive is detected. This will
                                        allow you to see if another OS is able to detect the drive, and run diagnostic

                                        issues can prevent your system from properly starting.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">The CMOS (complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor) battery on
                                        your motherboard is a battery-powered chip that stores essential system
                                        information like basic hardware settings and the date. The failure of the CMOS
                                        is often indicated by a constantly resetting clock, or a BIOS error message
                                        involving the CMOS. The lifespan of these batteries is usually around a decade
                                        under typical usage conditions, but this can vary. If you’re using an older or
                                        used motherboard, double checking that the battery is operating properly is
                                        worth trying. They are relatively affordable, and the replacement process is
                                        usually straightforward.
                                    </p>

                                        <li><strong>Find the battery.</strong> Locate the CMOS on your motherboard (it’s
                                            a silver, flat, coin-shaped battery.) If you have trouble finding it,
                                            consult your motherboard documentation.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Reseat the battery.</strong> Before attempting a replacement, pull
                                            the battery out, and reseat it. Removing the battery should be fairly
                                            straightforward. There may be a latch or clip holding it in place, but
                                            usually they can simply be removed by hand or gently with a screwdriver, and
                                            replaced in the same way.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Remove and replace the CMOS battery. </strong>If reseating doesn’t
                                            fix the issue, try a replacement. The most common CMOS battery is a CR2032,
                                            but when you remove the battery, be sure you take note of its features in
                                            order to find an identical replacement.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Restart your system.</strong> After you've successfully reseated or
                                            replaced the battery, restart your system, and enter the BIOS. You’ll then
                                            want to reset your date and time settings, save, and exit.</li>
