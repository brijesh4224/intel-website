                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1"><a href="#">Cloud computing</a> has become an essential part
                            of enterprise technology, helping you deliver applications and IT as a Service (ITaaS) to
                            your end users with ease and efficiency. Today, one of the most important parts of your
                            cloud strategy is choosing the right cloud service models for your organization.</p>
                        <p>As you explore your options, you’ll see choices like IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and similar terms.
                            These are all “as a service” models—part of a broader trend of “Everything as a Service” or
                            “XaaS.” The type of service you choose depends on your available infrastructure, IT staff
                            resources, cost considerations, and cloud security needs.</p>
                        <p>First, you’ll need to assess the best way to support your application or workload. There are
                            a variety of factors you will need to consider, such as application portability, data
                            portability, security, and compliance. These factors will influence whether you build on
                            premises or off premises.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">On-premises requires the highest level of management and the
                            greatest capital expenses but could be the most cost efficient in the long term. Everything
                            is run in a <a href="#">private cloud</a>, on hardware that belongs to your organization, by
                            your IT team.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Recently, cloud service providers have begun offering
                            on-premises “<a href="#">private cloud</a>” services. For example, IBM Cloud Private
                            delivers an application platform for developing and managing on-premises, containerized
                            applications. These new services help alleviate some of the management and capital expenses
                            related to on-premises cloud architectures.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Off-premises services, or <a href="#">public cloud</a>
                            services, are typically delivered by a cloud service provider and can be one of several
                            service model types.</p>
                        <p><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong></p>
                        <p>With Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), a cloud service provider owns and manages the
                            hardware upon which your software stack runs. That includes servers, networking, and
                            storage. This can be a great cost-reduction strategy if you’d like to avoid purchasing and
                            maintaining infrastructure.</p>
                        <p>However, there’s still plenty of work for your IT team. Under the IaaS model, your IT team
                            manages operating systems, databases, applications, functions, and all of your
                            organization’s data. As a result, they’ll typically have more control and flexibility
                            compared with other service models.</p>
                        <p>IaaS is self-service, which allows your IT team to access resources as needed through an API
                            or dashboard. Some common examples of IaaS include instances on Amazon Web Services (AWS),
                            Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure, which let you buy more or less capacity as you
                            go. That means there’s very little commitment involved—an advantage if you think your needs
                            will change in the near future. If you’re part of a large organization, you may also have
                            access to IaaS from another part of your enterprise.</p>
                        <p><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong></p>
                        <p>The next level of service is Platform as a Service (PaaS). PaaS is similar to IaaS, except
                            that your cloud service provider also provides the operating system and databases. That
                            means less work for your IT team. Your organization is still responsible for applications,
                            functions, and data.</p>
                        <p>PaaS gives your developers a simple, scalable platform for building applications. Much like
                            with IaaS, you can buy more resources as needed. And because multiple users can access the
                            development application at the same time, PaaS can streamline workflows and enhance
                            coordination. Some examples of PaaS are AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Google App Engine.</p>
                        <p><b>Software as a Service (SaaS)</b></p>
                        <p>Finally, Software as a Service (SaaS) offers the most support and is the simplest of all
                            delivery models for the end user. Chances are that you already use it in your organization.
                        </p>
                        <p>SaaS can be run in a multitenancy architecture, in which one instance of software serves
                            multiple users. Typically, SaaS products don’t involve a download or installation, saving
                            your end users from needing to manage software updates. All they’re responsible for is their
                            data. Popular examples of SaaS include CRM software, cloud-based file storage, and email.

                        <p>Besides IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, there are a couple of other types of cloud service models you
                            should know about.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Function as a Service (FaaS)</strong>&nbsp;- This provides yet another, deeper
                                layer of service. With FaaS, your users manage only functions and data. The cloud
                                service provider manages the applications you use. This option is especially popular
                                among developers, since you don’t pay for services when your code isn’t running. Common
                                functions include data processing, data validation or sorting, and back ends for mobile
                                and IoT applications. FaaS providers include AWS* Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google
                                Cloud Functions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Bare Metal as a Service (BMaaS)</strong> - Some enterprises feel uneasy about
                                migrating workloads to a virtualized cloud environment that’s shared with other
                                customers. An alternative to IaaS and PaaS is Bare Metal as a Service, or BMaaS. It
                                provides a way for enterprises to complement virtualized cloud services with a dedicated
                                server environment with the same agility, scalability, and efficiency as the cloud. In
                                particular, BMaaS is a great choice for enterprises that need to perform short-term,
                                data-intensive processing—such as media encoding or render farms—without latency or
                                overhead delays.</li>

                                Database as a Service (DBaaS) is a type of PaaS that delivers access to a database.
                                DBaaS can be a great way to enable the <a href="#">hybrid cloud</a>, since applications
                                can be moved between on-premise and cloud infrastructure with no impact on end users.
                                It’s also much easier to integrate new technologies through DBaaS since app developers
                                don’t need any additional resources to use them. One example of a DBaaS is Microsoft*
                                Azure SQL Database.</li>

                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Connecting your various cloud service models with your
                            on-premises and <a href="#">public cloud</a> resources can be a challenge. No matter which
                            models you choose, starting with a foundation of Intel® technology for your on-premises
                            infrastructure gives you compatibility with <a href="#">public cloud</a> services. That’s
                            because Intel technology is integrated and optimized throughout public cloud service
                            providers. The resulting combination of Intel® architecture in your private and <a
                                href="#">public cloud</a> enables 100 percent application compatibility,
                            workload-optimized performance, and a lower total cost of ownership. You can move your data
                            and applications without relearning, retesting, or revalidating your software and tool
                            environments.</p>
                        <p>We work closely with Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and other cloud
                            service providers to optimize performance on Intel technologies in their data centers. Our
                            work means you’ll get a great experience, no matter how you access cloud services.</p>
