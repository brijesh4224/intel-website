                    <p>NOTICE AND PROCEDURE FOR MAKING CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIGITAL
                        MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT (DMCA).</p>
                    <p>Intel Corporation (Intel) will respond to allegations of copyright violations in accordance with
                        the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The DMCA provides a process for a copyright owner
                        to give notification to an online service provider concerning alleged copyright infringement.
                        When a valid DMCA notification is received, the service provider responds under this process by
                        taking down the offending content. On taking down content under the DMCA, we will take
                        reasonable steps to contact the owner of the removed content so that a counter-notification may
                        be filed. On receiving a valid counter-notification, we generally restore the content in
                        question, unless we receive notice from the notification provider that a legal action has been
                        filed seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in the infringing
                        activity. Intel may provide copies of such notices to the participants in the dispute or to any
                        other third parties, at our discretion and as required by law. Intel's <a href="#"

                        notices.</p>
