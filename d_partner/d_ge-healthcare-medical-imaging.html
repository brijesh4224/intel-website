                        <p>When it comes to diagnosing critical patient conditions, every second matters. That’s why GE
                            Healthcare and Intel developed X-ray solutions intended to detect life-threatening
                            conditions in seconds, optimize workflows, and better prioritize critical cases to improve
                            the speed and accuracy of medical imaging.</p>
                        <h2 class="d_head">New X-Ray Intelligence Promises Improved Patient Care</h2>
                        <p>How could artificial intelligence (AI) be used to advance medical imaging and improve patient
                            outcomes? That was the question GE Healthcare sought to answer by immersing itself in
                            hospital workflows. They interviewed radiologists and technologists and observed operations
                            across the hospital to determine how staff uses X-ray equipment.</p>
                        <p>Next, hospital staff were asked to identify which of X-ray’s many uses would benefit most
                            from AI. The answer was clear: they wanted AI to help improve the handling of cases
                            involving critical findings to better treat patients. Specifically, they sought assistance
                            with those conditions that, while not common, could lead to life-threatening consequences if
                            overlooked.</p>
                        <p>Another pain point was the current first-in-first-out workflow, which commonly resulted in
                            long turn-around times (TATs), even among cases designated as emergency or stat. The
                            practice created a queue of stat cases with little clarity about which were to be addressed
                            first. Users wanted a solution that would help ensure that the right person evaluated the
                            X-ray at the right time, enabling the best possible patient care.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <h2 class="d_head">GE Healthcare’s Critical Care Suite Embeds AI on the Device</h2>
                        <p>In response to the needs of its customers, GE Healthcare developed its Critical Care Suite, a
                            set of AI algorithms built to detect critical findings on a chest X-ray. Available on Optima
                            XR240amx systems, the solution represents a significant step forward for the analysis of
                            X-rays, which account for about 50 percent of medical imaging today.</p>
                        <p>“What’s different about what GE Healthcare is doing is it’s a first-of-its-kind AI algorithm
                            that’s embedded on the imaging device,” said Todd Minnigh, CMO X-Ray, GE Healthcare. “So,
                            the thing that’s actually capturing the images is also doing the processing. It’s not in the
                            cloud and not on a server downstream somewhere. It can detect and enable providers to
                            prioritize critical conditions, so cases can be more quickly flagged.”</p>
                        <p>Running the algorithm at the point of care on the same Intel® processor-based systems
                            conducting the X-rays enables the hospital to identify key findings faster. AI findings of
                            potential critical conditions are sent to the radiologist at the same time as the original
                            image is sent to the picture archiving and communication system (PACS). Plus, the ability to
                            identify and flag quality issues in real time allows the technologist to determine if an
                            image should be repeated or reprocessed while the patient is still in the lab.</p>
                        <p>All of this can mean quicker access to results for anxious patients, easier repriorit</p>
                        <p>E Healthcare sought to test the solution by addressing one especially challenging use case
                            that uses X-rays to examine for pneumothorax, a life-threatening, difficult-to-detect
                            condition in which air or gas has entered the cavity between the lungs and the chest wall,
                            causing the lung to collapse.</p>

                            XR240amx X-Ray System by More Than 3x</h2>
                        <p>Today, most AI solutions targeting hospital workflows are located in the cloud or on a
                            hospital server. With the Critical Care Suite, GE Healthcare wanted to minimize cost,
                            shorten installation time, and reduce security vulnerabilities.3 Every second counts, so
                            processing and intelligence were located in the imaging device itself, thereby avoiding
                            unnecessary delays. It also negated the need for replacement or supplementary
                            infrastructure.</p>
                        <p>The goal of the Critical Care Suite is to optimize the frontal chest and lung field position
                            in X-rays while expediting delivery of the results of the pneumothorax inferencing once the
                            image has been captured. Moving the compute intelligence to the machine level would allow
                            for fast workflows and enable radiologists to rapidly process results for anxious patients
                            looking for peace of mind.</p>
                        <p>For support, GE Healthcare turned to Intel and its computer vision tools. Intel shared the
                            commitment to improve the speed of GE X-ray devices and deliver higher-quality X-ray imaging
                            to enhance patient care and outcomes. Intel helped optimize the Critical Care Suite
                            algorithms using the <a href="">Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit</a>. The toolkit
                            provided computer vision and deep learning inference tools, including convolutional
                            image-based classification models optimized for the Intel® processors used in GE Healthcare
                            imaging systems.</p>
                        <p>The move to the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit improved performance across all
                            models, with the pneumothorax model receiving the most benefit with inferencing time
                            dropping from more than three seconds to under one second.1 Pneumothorax inferencing on the
                            Optima XR240amx X-ray system accelerated by 3.3x compared to inferencing without
                            optimizations.1 Intel also helped train the GE Healthcare team to get the most out of its
                            algorithm going forward.</p>
                        <p>“Key to anyone’s success is you want to pick partners who are on the journey to help you be
                            successful,” said Katelyn Nye, X-ray Global Product Manager, Artificial Intelligence and
                            Analytics, GE Healthcare. “And Intel definitely did that for us.”</p>
                        <p>Also important to GE Healthcare was being able to serve its large install base of Intel-run
                            systems. The AI-powered innovation needed to be av</p>
                        <p>“For AI solutions to be adopted, they should integrate with existing workflows,” said Nye.
                            “You don’t want to add any overhead or burden. GE Healthcare’s approach to building
                            intelligent machines is avoiding any additional steps, workflow, or infrastructure if the
                            task can be performed with what the customer already has today.”</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <h2 class="d_head">Uncovering Small Issues Before They Become Big Ones</h2>
                        <p>In addition to the AI-based pneumothorax solution, GE Healthcare wanted AI applications that
                            helped technologists further contribute to improved patient care. That commitment led to the
                            development of three additional quality-based algorithms designed to help guide or coach the
                            technologist, regardless of their level of experience.</p>
                        <p>One example is the new intelligent autorotate algorithm. Technologists have typically been
                            required to manually rotate images to achieve the proper orientation. Estimates suggest that
                            automating that task alone will save technologists approximately 70,000 button clicks a
                            year, or up to three full working days.</p>
                        <p>GE Healthcare’s mission is to continue to find X-ray-related tasks that can be automated. In
                            this way, they can unlock data insights faster and free the technologist to move more
                            quickly through the 50 petabytes of data that hospitals now produce each year.</p>
                        <p>Working together, GE Healthcare and Intel understand that faster, higher-quality X-ray
                            imaging can lead to more productive staff, better care, and a healthier world.</p>
