                        <p>Recruitment purposes includes communicating with you, internally evaluating your qualifications and skills, preparing for interview or screening discussions (including arranging travel where applicable or reimbursing candidates for expense), and may entail background checks for certain roles which will be conduct with additional notice and in accordance with applicable laws.

Retention periods can vary significantly based on the type of information and how it is used. Intel retains&nbsp;recruitment related records for a maximum of three years following the end of the relationship except where a different retention period is required by applicable law, for example applicant data reporting requirements which may override Intel’s standard retention period.</p>

                        <p><b>APPENDIX FOR CANDIDATES IN THE EEA</b></p>
                        <p>If you are a candidate in the EEA applying for a position within Intel, Intel Corporation will be the controller of your data for the purposes of your application, administration, resource management, etc. Local hiring legal entities are data controllers for local recruitment, on-boarding, and any subsequent employment-related processing. The following sections provide additional information under the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation ("UK GDPR")<i> </i>and national data protection law.</p>
                        <p><b>Legal Basis, Data Protection Rights and Contact</b></p>
                        <p>We use a combination of legitimate interests, performance of a contract (including the intention to enter into a contract) and/or consent as the legal basis to process the personal information that you share with us as part of the recruitment process.</p>
                        <p>Candidates in the EEA can object to processing of their personal information, ask us to restrict processing of their personal information or request portability of their personal information. Where consent to the use of personal information has been obtained, it can be withdrawn at any time with future effect. Withdrawing consent will not affect (1) the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to the withdrawal, or (2) processing personal information under other legal bases.</p>
                        <p>If you believe we are using your personal information in a way that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice or for more information about your rights, contact your local data protection authority (contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area are available <a href="#" class="s_link_blue">here</a>.)</p>
                        <p>For personal information originating in the European Economic Area (EEA) that is transferred to an Intel entity outside the EEA that does not have an “adequate level of protection” as determined by the European Commission, it does so on the basis of its EEA binding corporate rules known as the Intel EEA Binding Corporate Rules ("EEA BCRs"). Intel’s EEA BCRs establish adequate protection of personal information and are legally binding on the subsidiaries and affiliates identified in Appendix 1 to the EEA BCRs. Intel's EEA BCRs can be accessed&nbsp;<a href="#" class="s_link_blue">here</a>. Where Intel's EEA BCRs do not apply, we rely on other lawful measures, such as contracts that include the EU standard contractual clauses.</p> 
                        <p>Likewise, for personal information originating in the United Kingdom (UK) that is transferred to an Intel entity outside of the UK that does not have an “adequate level of protection” (as determined by the competent UK authorities), it does so&nbsp;on the basis of&nbsp;its UK binding corporate rules&nbsp;known as&nbsp;the Intel UK Binding Corporate Rules ("UK BCRs").&nbsp;Intel’s UK BCRs&nbsp;establish adequate protection of personal information and are legally binding on the subsidiaries and affiliates identified in Appendix 1 to the&nbsp;UK&nbsp;BCRs. Intel's&nbsp;UK&nbsp;BCRs can be accessed&nbsp;<a href="#" class="s_link_blue">here</a>.&nbsp;Where Intel's&nbsp;UK&nbsp;BCRs do not apply, we rely on other lawful measures, such as&nbsp;standard&nbsp;contractual&nbsp;clauses, to provide appropriate safeguards for the personal information we transfer.</p>
                        <p>If you have questions, concerns or wish to make a request relating to any of the information in this Appendix, please contact us by using the "<b><i>How to Contact Us</i></b>" section in the <a href="./y_privacy.html" class="s_link_blue">Intel Privacy Notice.</a><br> </p>
