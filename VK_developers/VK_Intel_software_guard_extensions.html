                        <p>
                            Intel SGX is for application developers seeking to protect select code and data from
                            disclosure or modification. Intel SGX makes such protection possible by using enclaves.
                            Enclaves are protected areas of execution. Application code can be put into an enclave via
                            special instructions, and software can be made available to developers via the Intel® SGX
                            SDK for Linux* OS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The SDK is a collection of APIs, libraries, documentation, sample source code, and tools
                            that allow software developers to create and debug applications enabled by Intel SGX in
                            C/C++.

                                The enclave memory cannot be read or written from outside the enclave regardless of
                                current privilege level and CPU mode (ring3 [user-mode], ring0 [kernel-mode], system
                                management mode [SMM], VMM, or another enclave). The abort page is returned in such
                                conditions.
                            </li>

                                An enclave can be created with a debug attribute that allows a special debugger (Intel
                                SGX debugger) to view its content like a standard debugger. Production enclaves
                                (non-debug) cannot be debugged by software or hardware debuggers.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The enclave environment cannot be entered via classic function calls, jumps, register
                                manipulation, or stack manipulation. The only way to call an enclave function is via a
                                new instruction that performs several protective checks. Classic function calls
                                initiated by enclave code to functions inside the enclave are allowed.
                            </li>

                                CPU mode can only be 32- or 64-bit when executing enclave code. Other CPU modes are not
                                supported. An exception is raised in such conditions.

                                Tapping the memory or connecting the DRAM modules to another system only gives access to
                                encrypted data.

                                The memory encryption key randomly changes every power cycle (for example, boot, sleep,
                                or hibernate). The key is stored within the CPU and is not accessible.

                            Intel SGX uses strong industry-standard algorithms for signing enclaves. The signature of an
                            enclave characterizes the content and the layout of the enclave at build time. If the
                            enclave’s content and layout are not correct per the signature, the enclave fails to be
                            initialized and does not run. If an enclave is initialized, it should be identical to the
                            original enclave and is not modified at runtime.

                        <p>
                            Design for an Intel SGX application is different than a third-party application because it
                            requires dividing the application into two logical components:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Trusted component. The code that accesses the secret resides here, and is called an
                                enclave. More than one enclave can exist in an application.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Untrusted component. This is the rest of the application, including all of its modules.1
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            The application developer should make the trusted component as small as possible with a
                            minimal enclave interface definition. It is suggested that enclave functionality be limited
                            to operating on the secret data. A large enclave with complex interface definition presents
                            a larger attack surface than a small enclave with a small and concise interface.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-6 my-3">
                        <p>
                            The enclave code can leave the protected memory region and call functions in the untrusted
                            zone (by a special instruction). Reducing the enclave dependency on untrusted code also
                            strengthens its protection against possible attacks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Embracing the above design considerations improves protection as the attack surface is
                            minimized.

                            As the first step to harnessing the Intel® Software Guard Extensions SDK in the application,
                            developers must rearchitect or refactor the application to fit these guidelines. This is
                            accomplished by isolating the code modules that access any secrets, and then moving these
                            modules to a separate package or library. Sample code included in the Intel SGX SDK
                            demonstrates how to create an enclave.

                                Intel SGX Support in the Linux Kernel
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                The mainline Linux kernel has had built-in Intel SGX support since release 5.11. The
                                in-kernel Intel SGX driver requires the platform to support and to be configured for
                                flexible launch control (FLC). Use the mainline kernel with Intel SGX support whenever
                                possible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are two other kernel space options available for special use cases:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    If your distribution kernel is older than version 5.11 or does not have the
                                    in-kernel Intel SGX support, you can use the Intel SGX DCAP driver as a temporary
                                    solution before transitioning to kernel version 5.11 or later. It provides an
                                    interface close to the mainline kernel and also requires the platform to support and
                                    to be configured for FLC.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If you need to use a non-FLC platform, the Intel SGX for Linux OS driver project
                                    hosts an out-of-tree driver. This driver is provided to support running Intel SGX
                                    enclaves on platforms that only support legacy launch control. It may also be
                                    installed on platforms configured with FLC, but these platforms will only load
                                    production enclaves that conform to the legacy launch control policy.

                                Although the Intel SGX SDK and platform software are compatible with all of these
                                drivers, the legacy non-FLC driver and the Intel SGX DCAP driver are updated only for
                                critical security fixes. New features or functionalities implemented in the mainline
                                kernel cannot be ported to the legacy non-FLC driver or Intel SGX DCAP driver due to
                                limitations of being out-of-tree implementations.
