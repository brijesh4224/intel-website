                                students from getting the most out of their active learning time. Look for devices that
                                have the right capabilities for reliable access to the internet and that can support new
                                connection standards, like Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6E (Gig+). Some Intel-based Windows OS

                        that the device goes where the learning is happening, whether that’s a library, classroom,
                        coffee shop, friend’s house, or trip away from home. Laptops take up less physical space and can
                        be put away when not being used. And laptops make it possible to access licensed software even
                        when there is not an internet connection. As long as the laptop has ruggedness for durability,
                        fast and reliable connectivity, and a long battery life, the student is prepared to make the
                        most of any environment for learning.</div>
