                        <p></p>
                        <p>FTAs should prevent governments from requiring the localization of R&D, intellectual property, and manufacturing within their borders as a condition of market access. Such measures are counterproductive as they undermine competition and reduce global trade by more than $90 billion each year. These initiatives also undermine innovation and are especially harmful to the tech sector as it is based on a complex global supply chain.</p>

                        <p>Robust encryption technology is necessary to protect digital devices and networks. The number and seriousness of cybersecurity attacks continue to grow. Regulatory barriers to the use of cryptography run the risk of decreasing the overall security of computing devices and the internet.</p>

                        <p>Broad compulsory licensing requirements or requiring unnecessary confidential information as a condition of product approvals and market access are on the rise in emerging markets.

                        <p>FTAs should constrain governments from picking winners and losers. Technology mandates are only justified in very limited circumstances that deal with public health and safety; yet, as global competitiveness increases, attempts to require the use of domestic technologies to favor local companies are increasing as well.</p>

                            <p>Current WTO negotiations provide an opportunity to reach a global agreement on provisions that meaningfully combat barriers to data flows, including those affecting financial data to ensure a stable and robust global supply chain that benefits traders and consumers in every geography.

                            <p>Companies should not be required to disclose source code, algorithms, or encryption keys as a requirement for market access or entry. Innovation depends on the ability to develop and use proprietary software and to secure products and systems with private encryption keys.</p>
                            <p>Some economies have unfairly advantaged their domestic industry by demanding that foreign companies transfer source code, algorithms, or encryption keys as a condition for doing business in their territory. In other scenarios, concerns around government access to encrypted data have led to requirements that firms build “back doors” to digital products that can put intellectual property at risk.</p>

                            <p></p>
                            <p>Intel strongly supports extending and making permanent the WTO moratorium on customs duties. As a company that operates in over 50 countries around the world, it is critical that data can flow between teams without having to track and pay customs duties. Without this policy in place, it could be cost-prohibitive to operate in a location that assesses duties on digital transmissions.</p>

                        <p>Intel supports public policies to help open markets, enhance supply chain resilience, and ensure seamless customs processes that eliminate unnecessary regulations worldwide. We value policies that streamline the process and ensure that different countries' customs systems align. Maintaining modern and easy-to-follow customs and trade procedures is highly important to major global supply chain participants like Intel. Our business activities span over 100 countries, with nearly 80% of sales taking place outside the United States. Intel heavily depends upon the ability to quickly move products across international borders cost-effectively and with minimal burdens. Such policies ensure that any consumer can access the best available products at market-based prices.</p>
