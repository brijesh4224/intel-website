                        <p class="pt-5">Artificial intelligence (AI) improves through training over vast data sets.
                            Typically, this means sharing and then centralizing those data sets in one location, but
                            this becomes a concern when the training involves sensitive data. Federated learning (FL) is
                            a distributed machine learning (ML) approach that enables organizational collaboration
                            without exposing sensitive data or ML algorithms. Research in federated learning explores
                            securely connecting multiple systems and datasets and removing the barriers preventing the
                            aggregation of data for analysis. Industries such as retail, manufacturing, healthcare, and
                            financial services can benefit from federated learning to gain valuable insights from data.

                        <p>Intel Labs participates in many endeavors to encourage collaboration and bring world-changing
                            concepts from ideation to production. Often times, partnerships with academic institutions
                            have the power to transform research methodology into real-world applications that have the
                            potential to revolutionize industries and even save lives. In one such collaboration, we
                            provided the Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics at the University of
                            Pennsylvania (UPenn) Perlman with Intel processor-based servers to assist the Federated

                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Early detection of brain tumors can reduce the impact of
                            surgery and treatment, improving the prognosis for many patients. But as healthcare shifts
                            from reactive to proactive scanning, the number of skilled technicians cannot keep up with
                            the number of brain scans generated. To protect information while still leveraging ML models
                            to automate scan analysis, Intel Labs and UPenn used data from over 71 medical institutions
                            to&nbsp;<a

                                and test the efficacy of federated learning for brain tumor edge detection</a>. With
                            federated learning powered by hardware and software from Intel, sensitive data can be
                            secured at its source, while the AI model still benefits from a larger data set.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">In 2018, Penn Medicine and Intel Labs presented <a
                                href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-11723-8_9">preliminary
                                results</a> on federated learning in the medical imaging domain, demonstrating that FL
                            could train a model with over 99% of the accuracy of a model trained in the traditional,
                            non-private method. Over several years, the project has demonstrated FL’s influence in
                            revolutionizing healthcare as well as the value of running FL on Intel technology. Updated
                            results have shown increased performance as well, including:</p>
                        <ul>

                            <li>Up to 33% more accurate brain tumor detection compared to models trained on publicly
                                available datasets.</li>
                            <li>Up to 4.48x lower latency and 2.29x lower memory utilization, compared to the first

                        </ul>
                        <p>Many technical components combined to bring about these results. Working in tandem, Intel
                            hardware and software provide additional privacy to the model and data while taking
                            advantage of pre-packaged tools and libraries to create an open, secure, and optimized
                            system that is easy to deploy. Our work in federated learning relies heavily on four key
                            pillars. The first pillar is Intel® Software Guard Extensions (SGX) which, leveraged by our
                            OpenFL framework, enforces federation rules and prevents data exposure. Then, to simplify
                            implementation, the program utilizes Gramine, an open-source library OS, and finally, once
                            trained, the Intel® Distribution for OpenVINO™ toolkit works to optimize the AI model. Read
                            on to learn more about each of these vital elements.</p>

                            SGX)</a></h4>
                    <p>Over a decade ago, Intel Labs began groundbreaking research into how data—and the code that uses
                        the data—could be protected while an application is running. The result was Intel SGX, now a
                        mature, enterprise-grade technology available with 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable
                        processors. Intel SGX allows organizations to isolate the software and data from the underlying
                        infrastructure (hardware or OS) by using hardware-level encryption, which creates secure
                        enclaves. In addition to helping defend against the myriad of more common software-based
                        attacks, Intel SGX’s attestation mechanisms can verify that an application has not been
                        compromised and that the processor it is running on has the latest security updates.</p>

                    <h4 class=" mt-5 pt-4 k_plink1 k_intext1blue1"><a href="#">OpenFL</a></h4>
                    <p>OpenFL is an open-source, Python 3-based framework for FL that is designed to be an easy-to-use,
                        secure, scalable and extensible tool for data scientists. OpenFL is available on GitHub, along
                        with tutorials and documentation to help organizations get started with their own FL projects.
                        OpenFL is designed to be compatible with any ML or deep learning (DL) framework, and has
                        tutorials and multiple examples using TensorFlow, PyTorch and MXNet. OpenFL combines hardware
                        and software to enable privacy-preserving AI using Intel SGX and Gramine (more on Gramine in the
                        next section). As of OpenFL v.1.3, the framework can run within an Intel SGX enclave. OpenFL
                        helps institutions to collaborate and run their models in a federated manner while helping to
                        improve the protection of sensitive information with the help of Intel SGX and Gramine.</p>

                    <p>The Gramine Project is now a Confidential Computing Consortium project, of which Intel is a
                        founding member. The Gramine Project provides tools and infrastructure components for running
                        unmodified applications on confidential computing platforms based on Intel SGX. Gramine
                        fast-tracks secure deployment of complex software stacks within Intel SGX by eliminating
                        additional developer effort. It also provides tools for developing end-to-end secure solutions
                        with Intel SGX enclaves that shield proprietary code and sensitive data from hackers, whether
                        the data is in a state of use, in transit or at rest. Using Gramine, organizations seeking
                        additional privacy protection for their FL projects can use Intel SGX more easily. Intel SGX is
                        the most researched, updated and deployed hardware-based trusted execution environment (TEE) for
                        the data center, and Gramine is one of the few frameworks that supports multi-process
                        applications by providing a complete and secure fork implementation.</p>

                        (DL) models for optimal execution on endpoint target devices. Optimizations include reducing the
                        model’s size (such as the number of parameters and layers) and speeding models up. Using the
                        Model Optimizer results in an Intermediate Representation (IR), which then passes to the
                        Inference Engine, where the model undergoes further optimizations based on the target end
                        device. For the Penn Medicine project, using the Intel Distribution of OpenVINO toolkit resulted
                        in up to 4.48x lower latency and 2.29x lower memory utilization, compared to the first consensus
                        model created in 2020. With lower latency and memory utilization, this optimized model could run
                        on edge systems at clinics instead of requiring large data center resources.</p>
