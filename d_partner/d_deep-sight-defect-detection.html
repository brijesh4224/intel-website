                                <li class="pb-1">DeepSight and Intel enabled a leading tire maker to resolve defects its
                                    human inspectors had not been able to see before—and do it more quickly.</li>
                                <li>Thanks to the Intel®-based DeepSight solution, the tire manufacturer has improved
                                    its defect detection accuracy rate to more than 99.9 percent</li>
                                <li>Automating and accelerating early defect detection to less than one second per
                                    inspection allowed the tire maker to maximize production efficiency while reducing
                                    overall costs.</li>

                        <p>When the tiniest defects can damage a manufacturer’s productivity and profitability,
                            everything matters. Shanghai DeepSight and Intel increased defect detection accuracy to more
                            than 99.9 percent and helped cut labor costs by approximately USD 42,000 per production line
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">The Huge Opportunity in Small Defects</h2>
                        <p>Today, the People’s Republic of China boasts some 600 tire manufacturers that together
                            generate approximately 800 million units annually or fully one-third of the total tire
                            output globally.</p>
                        <p>Ensuring consistent product quality at this scale is a challenge. Most companies rely on
                            manual inspection, a time-consuming, and unreliable strategy. It takes around three months
                            to train inspectors, with inspections occupying up to 80 percent of their time. Even fully
                            trained, humans make subjective judgments and are typically only able to maintain a 90 to 95
                            percent accuracy rate.</p>
                        <p>One major tire manufacturer decided to pursue a different path, turning to experienced
                            technology partners for a better solution. The results have been dramatic.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">DeepSight Focuses AI on Preventing Defects</h2>

                            difference for businesses.</p>
                        <p>DeepSight brings highly accurate, highly stable testing products that effectively help
                            customers solve problems. The company is also firmly rooted in the industrial sector, having
                            undertaken many successful industry collaborations that focus on industrial defect
                            detection.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Rooting Out Tiny Tire Flaws</h2>
                        <p>Drawing on its AI expertise, DeepSight addressed the tire manufacturer’s ongoing defect
                            challenge through computer vision. Different types of defects need different imaging systems
                            in order to obtain the best images. The DeepSight solution is based on deep learning and
                            relies on tremendous computing capability. The imaging system includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A camera</li>
                            <li>A lens</li>
                            <li>A light source</li>
                            <li>The mechanical structure (different types of defects require different imaging systems)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The solution’s edge equipment is comprised of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An <a href="">Intel®-based industrial computer</a> and display for image analysis,
                                display, and data storage</li>
                            <li>DeepSight Deep Inspect for defect detection</li>
                            <li>The Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The image data is first collected by the imaging system. It is then transmitted to the edge
                            device for real-time detection and analysis by DeepSight’s software, Deep Inspect. The
                            results are then communicated back to the production line for classification.</p>
                        <p>The DeepSight testing equipment replaces the original testing equipment. The configured
                            interface can be directly connected with the customer’s production line, enabling the
                            customer to check the accuracy and stability of the testing equipment through sampling.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">DeepSight Partners with Intel to Speed Detection</h2>
                        <p>DeepSight’s core team originated at Intel Labs. So to achieve the best detection results,
                            DeepSight turned to Intel, which brought key technologies to the equation as well as
                            critical experience in AI, computer vision, and deep learning. Intel optimized the algorithm
                            using the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit.</p>
                        <p>The toolkit provided computer vision and deep learning inference tools optimized for Intel®
                            processors, resulting in significant performance improvements. By accelerating Intel®
                            hardware with the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit, DeepSight was able to make its
                            detection model algorithm run stably on one regular industrial computer.</p>
                        <p>The integrated hardware and software accelerated performance and allowed the DeepSight
                            inspection software to detect defects faster. This saved time on optimization and
                            development and enabled quicker deployment.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Converting Small Defects into Big Benefits</h2>
                        <p>Automating and accelerating early defect detection allowed the tire maker to maximize
                            production while reducing waste and overall costs. The effort also managed to achieve high
                            stability and a low environmental impact.</p>
                        <p>Now the problems that cause tire defects can be addressed earlier in the manufacturing
                            process instead of after the tires roll off the production line. Today, thanks to the
                            Intel®-based DeepSight solution, the manufacturer is able to inspect more than 20,000 tires
                            per day in real time with an improved accuracy rate of more than 99.9 percent.</p>
                        <p>Detection speed has also dramatically improved over traditional manual inspection, now
                            averaging less than one second per inspection, a dramatic improvement in detection time over
                            previous methods. Better speed and accuracy have benefited the bottom line as well, helping
                            drive down labor costs by approximately USD 42,000 per production line.</p>
                        <p>The solution runs fast, matching the speed of the original production line, an achievement
                            much appreciated by the tire manufacturer. It also offers strong scalability and expedited
                            learning in the case of new defects. Based on this early success, the DeepSight solution has
                            since been deployed in additional production lines and is slated to be used for other
                            related tire inspections as well.</p>

                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">DeepSight and Intel Help Tire Maker Shift into High Gear</h2>
                        <p>Working together, DeepSight technology, Intel® Core™ processors, and the Intel® Distribution
                            of OpenVINO™ toolkit enabled DeepSight’s manufacturing customer to quickly identify things
                            its human inspectors had not been able to see before while also eliminating inspection tasks
                            that can strain inspectors’ eyesight. And because machine inspection is objective and free
                            from fatigue, it can run continuously and with greater speed and efficiency.</p>
                        <p>By empowering the company to address the root cause of tire defects before they become bigger
                            problems, DeepSight helped the tire maker achieve welcome improvements in production
                            efficiency, deployment speed, worker productivity, waste reduction, and product quality.</p>
