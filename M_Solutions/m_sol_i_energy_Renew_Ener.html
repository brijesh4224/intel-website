Now, companies, cities, countries, and entire regions are rushing to embrace renewable energy, the fastest-growing global energy source.

Now both solar and wind power have reached or exceeded parity in many places. The issue of variable supply is still a challenge, but the combination of economic and environmental benefits, plus continuously evolving technology, will make renewable energy a clear—and clean—solution.

They can capture and transfer data on energy conversion, storage, and delivery so it can be analyzed in near-real time. Being able to predict energy usage patterns lets utilities maintain sufficient power supplies even during times of high fluctuation. This helps renewables operate at maximum capability, making them more competitive in the open market.

Modern controllers have to be reliable and offer scalable performance and a range of communications options. They also need to be rugged, since they often have to operate consistently in harsh conditions like spinning wind turbines or scorching solar farms.

                                Intel® technology-based gateway controllers form a vital part of an extensive network of connected devices that make sure renewable energy from multiple sources is available where it’s needed most.  <a href="" class="m_ai_link">Intel®-based Active Grid Management Architecture</a> uses real-time monitoring and control hardware based on IoT technologies to improve situational awareness of grid performance. Utilities take advantage of IoT technologies to collect and analyze DER data from across the grid. The result is a more stable grid, lower operating costs, and utilities that can manage their energy capacity more effectively. Open AGM architecture is highly modular, scalable, and interoperable.

                                As an example, Axiomtek’s embedded gateway controllers, using software solutions–based Intel® architecture, helps utilities and energy companies collect, filter, and analyze data from the cloud to the edge, with the ultimate goal of optimizing smart grid manageability across both legacy and modern systems.

                                To accelerate the adoption of new technology, Intel is learning from customers and partnering with vendors to build a robust culture of ecosystem players. Intelligent systems and the powerful information they provide are a major step toward sustainability and energy independence. And as renewables become more cost-effective and reliable, they’ll be more available to communities, cities, and countries in the developing world.
