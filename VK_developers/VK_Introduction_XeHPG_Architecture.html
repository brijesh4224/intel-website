                                <p>
                                    State-of-the-art immersive computer graphics for TV shows and movies are the current
                                    benchmark for visual effects achievement, which makes them the near-term goal for
                                    real-time gaming. This goal is driving an insatiable demand for the latest
                                    technologies and research.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Intel Xe Architecture is a proprietary IntelÂ® GPU technology that represents a
                                    significant leap in terms of efficiency and performance. Intelâs Xe-LP graphics was
                                    the first instance of this technology, pushing the performance on highly portable
                                    devices. Xe-HPG takes this baseline and springboards from it, with performance gains
                                    targeted at the discrete GPU market to meet the consumer demand for PC gaming.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Intelâs Xe-HPG GPUs (such as the ACM-G10 and the ACM-G11) are built on Taiwan
                                    Semiconductorâs (TSMC) N6 process. The GPUs power the new Intel Arc A-series
                                    discrete cards and mobile products (formerly code-named Alchemist, also referred to
                                    as DG2). While Xe-HPG will ship with a maximum of 32 Xe-cores, other reduced
                                    configurations match a complete family of SKUs.
                                </p>

                                    The goal of the Xe-HPG design is to extend the baseline of significant architectural
                                    and micro-architectural enhancements provided by the Xe-LP architecture, and scale
                                    it up for highly performant discrete GPUs. Xe-HPG graphics architecture delivers a
                                    massive improvement in floating point and integer compute capabilities that takes
                                    advantage of a high-bandwidth memory hierarchy.

                                    Xe-HPG contains up to 32 Xe-cores and 512 vector engines (XVE), which increase the
                                    core compute capability per clock by greater than 51 over Xe-LP devices with up to
                                    96 vector engines, previously called EUs, or execution units. Additionally, it
                                    contains dedicated matrix engines (XMX), and a real-time ray tracing fixed-function
                                    block. Xe-HPG addresses the corresponding bandwidth needs by using the latest
                                    graphics memory technology (Graphics Double Data Rate 6, or GDDR6).

                                    Xe-HPG has made considerable improvements to the Xe-LP design, realized in gaming
                                    and compute workloads. Advances were targeted to improve XVE latency, as well as
                                    increasing latency tolerance, and improvements in the caching hierarchy.

                                    Deep learning (DL) applications have exceeded all expectations in the last five
                                    years. The primary building blocks of many deep learning applications are
                                    high-throughput multiply-accumulate operations. These can be used to implement
                                    optimized deep learning convolutions, as well as optimized general matrix-multiply
                                    (GEMM) operations. In addition to increasing the peak FP32 performance 5x over
                                    Xe-LP, Xe-HPG includes XMX engines built with systolic arrays to enable up to 275
                                    teraOPS (TOPs) of compute performance. Xe-HPG supports FP16, BF16, INT8, INT4, and
                                    INT2 data formats to provide a range of quantization for inferencing workloads,

                                    One of the applications of the XMX engines in Xe-HPG is the application of XeSS, a
                                    method targeted at upscaling content rendered at a lower resolution with up to 4x
                                    increase in resolution while maintaining excellent image quality. Most modern games
                                    and game engines use a temporal antialiasing pass, and XeSS uses the available TAA
                                    inputs to upscale the resolution up to 4x, with little-to-no image quality impact.

                                    Ray tracing is widely regarded as the highest fidelity technique for simulating
                                    physical light behavior in 3D graphics and is used in most offline-rendered
                                    computer-generated films. In games, ray tracing is used to enable global
                                    illumination, realistic shadows, reflections, ambient occlusion, and more. Games
                                    mandate high performance in real time and use rasterization instead of ray tracing;
                                    this enables a trade-off between quality and performance.

                                    Current advances in the levels of performance allow for a hybrid model that enables
                                    ray-tracing effects layered alongside the traditional rasterization. Xe-HPG fully
                                    supports DirectX* ray tracing (DXR) 1.0, DXR 1.1, and Vulkan* Run Time Libraries
                                    (Vulkan*RT); this enables ISVs to use the new ray-tracing techniques in their
                                    existing gaming pipelines.

                                    The mesh-shading feature supports a one- or two-stage compute-like shader pipeline,
                                    which is used to generate 3D primitives. These are fed directly into the existing
                                    rasterization pipeline. Mesh shading gives applications increased flexibility and
                                    performance for the definition and generation of 3D primitives. The mesh-shading
                                    capability can be used as a replacement for the 3D geometry pipeline (vertex input,
                                    vertex shading, tessellation, and geometry shading). Microsoft* introduced
                                    mesh-shading Tier 1 as a new feature in DirectX 12 Ultimate*, and an extension also

                                    Variable rate shading (VRS) is a technique for giving the developer better control
                                    over which pixels to spend time shading. For example, if an object or region of the
                                    screen is undergoing motion blur, or objects are hidden behind smoke or fog, it
                                    often does not make sense to spend time shading when the results are not seen by the
                                    user in the final image. Display densities have increased each generation, with
                                    double or even quadruple the number of pixels in the same region of space. This
                                    motivates the need for better control of the amount of shading across the display,
                                    so shading resources are used where they are needed the most.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    While Xe-LP already supports VRS Tier 1, Xe-HPG additionally supports VRS Tier 2.
                                    VRS Tier 1 included the ability to set the shading rate for every draw call. VRS
                                    Tier 2 enables you to set the shading rate via an image mask, where each pixel of
                                    the image mask defines the shading rate for an 8x8 tile of the render target. Every
                                    tile of the image mask can be updated based on a variety of parameters that impact
                                    on the required shading resolution. For example, the amount of color intensity
                                    changes within a region of the previous frame. Motion of objects in the scene,
                                    camera parameters, or any number of other factors can vary across the display. In
                                    addition to being able to adjust the shading rate using an image mask, VRS Tier 2
                                    also adds the ability to set the shading rate for every triangle rendered, giving
                                    the programmer the ultimate level of control.
                                </p>

                                    Intel supports a finer-grained image mask than other hardware vendors at 8x8, but
                                    also an expanded range of shading rates going beyond the standard 1x1, 1x2, 2x1, and
                                    2x2, adding the ability to use shading rates 2x4, 4x2, and 4x4. These additional
                                    shading rates give the programmer even more control of performance, with no loss in
                                    perceived visual qualityâa 4x4 coarse pixel has four times fewer invocations than a
                                    2x2 coarse pixel. This means that the same number of displayable pixels can be
                                    shaded using only 25% of the resources when compared to using 2x2 coarse pixels.

                                    Sampler feedback is a hardware-accelerated feature introduced in DirectX Feature
                                    Level 12_2 and supported by Xe-LP and later. Conceptually, it is the reverse of
                                    texture sampling: the sample() shader intrinsic reads a number of texels from a
                                    texture and returns an average value. The new WriteSamplerFeedback() shader
                                    intrinsic writes to a binary resource âmarkingâ the texels that would have been
                                    read. This enables two important uses: sampler feedback streaming, and texture space
                                    shading.

                                    This feature allows pixel shading to be independent of the geometric complexity of
                                    screen resolution and adds new texture level-of-detail methods to control the level
                                    of shading detail. These abilities are introduced to temporally decouple the shading
                                    pipeline from the traditional sample-, pixel-, or coarse-shading rates. Sampler
                                    feedback can provide sizable gains over traditional pixel-shader approaches, as
                                    shader complexity, geometry, or MSAA samples increases.

                                    meet a wide range of product performance demands across a wide range of thermal
                                    design power.

                                    Xe-HPG has enhancements to support the latest APIs, including DirectX 12 Ultimate
                                    features, and corresponding support in Vulkan APIs. As shown in Figure 2, the
                                    flagship device features eight render slices with four Xe-cores, each containing 16
                                    XVEs for a total of 512 XVEs, and 16 MB of L2$, as shown in the following.

                                <p>
                                    As with Xe-LP, the basic scalable building block of the
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Xe-HPG compute + render engine architecture is called the âslice.â In Xe-HPG, the
                                    number of slices varies from 2 to 8, based on the SKU. Increasing the slice count
                                    increases overall 3D and compute assets in the machine in a balanced fashion, and
                                    can be leveraged to build a wide range of SKUs that support different power and
                                    performance needs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Each slice is built from several Xe-cores, each of which contain 16 vector engines
                                    (XVE), 16 matrix engines (XMX), a load/store unit (or data port), and a shared
                                    L1/SLM cache. The current instance of the Xe-HPG slice contains a maximum of four
                                    Xe-cores.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Each Xe-core is attached to a set of dedicated graphics acceleration fixed function
                                    pipelines with a ray-tracing unit (RTU), a thread-sorting unit (TSU), and, of
                                    course, a sampler.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In addition, each slice contains the remainder of the fixed function blocks that
                                    support rendering functions, including geometry/tessellation, mesh dispatch logic,
                                    setup/raster, depth and stencil processing, pixel dispatch logic, and pixel back
                                    end. Xe-HPG has increased the fixed function-to- compute ratio, compared to Xe-LP,
                                    to address increasing requirements.
                                </p>

                                    Xe-HPG's overall goal was to increase performance-per-watt or efficiency, through
                                    improvements in performance at frequency, increased frequency at voltage, and
                                    reduced energy per frame.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Performance at frequency was achieved via key architectural changes, as well as
                                    compiler optimizations targeting newer workloads. For Xe-HPG, there were significant
                                    efforts made to target higher frequency.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Additionally, the N6 process also offers additional v-f improvements. The goal was
                                    to achieve up to 1.5x increase in frequency at iso voltage. Energy-per-frame is
                                    reduced by micro-architectural optimizations, and intrinsic dynamic capacitance
                                    (Cdyn) reductions. Reduction in bandwidth utilization through better caching and
                                    compression allows redirection of power to the GPU, improving performance.
                                </p>

                                    These improvements allow Xe-HPG to run up to 2.1 GHz in its most performant
                                    configuration. This allows Xe-HPG to deliver:

                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    Xe-HPG brings considerable advances to the Xe-core design, which are realized in
                                    gaming and compute workloads. The vector engine (XVE) is the subblock executing
                                    instructions, and is similar to the block named execution unit, or EU, in the Xe-LP
                                    architecture. In each XVE, the primary computation units are Single Instruction,
                                    Multiple Data (SIMD) floating-point units (known as arithmetic logic units, or
                                    ALUs). Although called ALUs, they can support floating-point and integer
                                    instructions such as MAD or MUL, as well as extended math (EM) instructions, such as
                                    exp, log, and rcp. In addition, the ALUs also support logical instructions. On Xe-LP
                                    architecture, each EU can co-issue an eight-wide ALU floating-point or integer
                                    instruction, plus a two-wide extended math instruction. Xe-LP also allows Send and
                                    Branch to be co-issued with the ALU operations.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    From a raw compute perspective, Xe-HPG reorganized the ALUs with the ability to
                                    co-issue floating-point instructions and integer instructions on the XVEs. Xe-HPG
                                    also adds the Xe Matrix Extension (XMX), a new systolic array of ALUs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This instruction, named Dot Product Accumulate Systolic (DPAS), can be co-issued as
                                    well.

                                    Both architectures derive data-locality benefits from running two XVEs, or two EUs,
                                    in lockstep (see Figure 4).

                                    Xe-HPG makes further design changes to improve latencies, as well as improving
                                    latency tolerance by adding an additional thread per XVE and corresponding register

                                    Part of the Xe-core is also the instruction cache. Xe-HPG adds a prefetch mechanism
                                    to improve the performance of kernels, which are short when instruction fetch
                                    constitutes much of the thread execution and displays a high degree of temporal and
                                    spatial locality.

                                    Deep learning networks have become one of the biggest general-purpose GPU (GPGPU)
                                    usage models, and can use lower precision instructions with minor impact to
                                    inference accuracy. As with Xe-LP, Xe-HPG supports INT8 accessed via DP4a
                                    instruction. However, one of the changes made to the Xe-core in Xe-HPG, is the
                                    addition of 16 XMX engines that can be accessed using the new Dot Product Accumulate
                                    Systolic (DPAS) instruction. It supports FP16, BF16, INT8, INT4 and INT2 multiply,
                                    with either 16 or 32 bits accumulate. Figure 5 shows both DP4A and DPAS instruction
                                    flow.

                                    The texture sampler is a critical unit attached to the Xe-core that supports up to a
                                    peak of eight texels per clock, similar to Xe-LP. Intel improved the sampler
                                    capability to run at higher frequencies, but there are also other performance
                                    optimizations. One of the notable changes is improved anisotropic performance for
                                    some of the block compression (BCx) formats, which are common in games. Other
                                    improvements enhance power efficiency as well as performance for certain formats
                                    commonly used in games.

                                    the XVEs to kick off traversal including intersection tests. Each RTU has a bounding
                                    volume hierarchy (BVH) cache to reduce the average latency of fetching BVH data and
                                    is capable of processing multiple rays for higher efficiency. Each RTU supports a
                                    12âtoâ1 ratio of ray-box intersection tests per clock and ray-triangle tests per
                                    clock.

                                <p>
                                    Additionally, each RTU is supported by a thread-sorting unit (TSU), a dedicated
                                    hardware block that can sort and re-emit shader threads to maximize SIMD coherence
                                    from divergent rays.

                                    To meet the high bandwidth demand of the XMX instructions and the ray-tracing units,
                                    Xe-HPG implements a newly designed read/write L1-cache unit in each Xe-core. The new
                                    L1-cache unit handles all unformatted load/store accesses to memory, and shared
                                    local memory (SLM). Based on the shader requirement, the cache storage can be
                                    dynamically partitioned between L1-cache and SLM, featuring up to 192 KB of L1 cache
                                    or up to 128 KB of SLM. Formatted data load/ store (such as typed unordered access
                                    views [UAVs]) are handled by the data port pipeline, which shares a separate, 64 KB
                                    read-only cache with the texture sampler unit.

                                    low-latency, high-bandwidth L1 cache also improves shaders with frequent accesses to
                                    SLM, dynamically indexed constant buffers, and high register spill-fills.

                                    The Xe-HPG geometry fixed function pipeline contains the typical render front end
                                    that maps to the logical API pipeline. Enhancements include provisions to support
                                    distribution of the geometry work between the various slices for larger devices,
                                    while increasing peak fixed-function rate.

                                    A significant change is the addition of a two-stage mesh-shading pipeline introduced
                                    in DirectX Ultimate as well as Vulkan.

                                    feeding into the rasterization function, the implementation is an alternate
                                    operating mode of the geometry fixed function, leveraging similar existing device
                                    assets. When operating in mesh-shading mode:

                                        The global vertex fetch distributes geometry work to slices when in geometry
                                        mode and is reused to distribute mesh-shader dispatch work to slices in a

                                    accumulates subspans/pixel information and dispatches threads to the XVEs. The block
                                    load balances across the multiple Xe-cores and ensures the order in which pixels
                                    retire from the shader units. It also includes support for variable rate shading
                                    (VRS), which reduces the pixel shader invocations, and in Xe-HPG has been enhanced

                                    block granularity. In addition, the HiZ block supports fast clear, which allows

                                    data moving to and from device memory. The L2 cache is used as backing storage for
                                    sampler, data port, color, Z, UAV, and instruction streams.

                                    The L2 cache is a highly banked multiway set-associative cache. Fine-grain controls
                                    in the L2 allow selective caching of data, as well as provisioning of different
                                    classes of services to streams of traffic. Each of the banks can perform one 64 byte
                                    read-or-write operation every clock. The L2 cache forms a single contiguous memory
                                    space across all the banks and sub-banks in the design. The 32 Xe-cores
                                    configuration supports a peak of 2048 bytes/clock for read or write. In typical
                                    3D/compute workloads, partial access is common and occurs in batches, making
                                    ineffective use of memory bandwidth. L2 cache opportunistically combines partial
                                    accesses into a single 64Byte access, improving efficiency.

                                    Xe-HPG graphics architecture continues the investment in technologies that improve
                                    graphic memory efficiency, in addition to improving raw memory bandwidth. As games
                                    target higher quality visuals, the memory bandwidth requirement significantly
                                    increases. Xe-HPG uses a new unified, lossless compression algorithm that is
                                    universal across color, depth, and stencil, as well as media and compute. The data
                                    can be stored in the L2 cache in compressed as well as uncompressed form, yielding
                                    benefit for both capacity and bandwidth.
