                        </h2>
                        <p>In today’s modern world, most people see slavery as a historical phenomenon. While the media
                            occasionally covers stories about victims, we tend to think of slavery and human trafficking
                            as tragedies whose time has passed. </p>
                        <p>Not so. Most people today would be shocked to know that there are more than 50 million human
                            beings trapped in slavery today, more than at any point in history.1 Slavery in the 21st
                            century is a crime that takes many forms, including sexual exploitation (primarily of women
                            and children), forced labor, domestic servitude, criminal exploitation, organ harvesting,
                            and forced marriage. It also includes human trafficking and smuggling, which often involves
                            recruiting individuals through threats, force, fraud, coercion, or deception on the part of
                            criminals in positions of power. </p>
                        <p>Standing in opposition to these crimes are groups such as <a href="" style="color: #0068B5; text-decoration: underline  !important;text-underline-offset: .3rem !important;">Hope for Justice</a>, a
                            non-governmental organization working to end modern slavery and human trafficking and
                            protect the rights of victims and survivors. Founded in 2008, Hope for Justice works to
                            prevent human trafficking; to investigate and identify cases and accompany survivors as they
                            claim their rights to justice, protection, and redress; and to partner with survivors’ and
                            other civil society organizations, companies, and governments to address the root causes of
                            people’s vulnerability to modern slavery.</p>

                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;" class="fw-lighter">Data as a Tool for Justice</h2>
                        <p>In combating modern slavery, data plays a role that is hard to overstate. Imitating
                            legitimate businesses, criminal organizations that profit from human exploitation are
                            skilled at using data and technology to advance their efforts. In response, institutions and
                            organizations like Hope for Justice are looking to harness technology and data to close the
                            technology gap, utilizing it as a tool for good. </p>
                        <p>Globally, organizations working on cases of human trafficking have collected large pools of
                            valuable data on both victims of slavery and perpetrators, as well as contextual information
                            relating to emerging patterns and trends. </p>
                        <p>Victim data is incredibly sensitive and invariably includes personally identifiable
                            information, while data on perpetrators may include the financial flows and organizational
                            structures of criminal enterprises. All of this data is crucial information towards
                            effective investigation and mitigation. However, if this sensitive data is leaked via
                            mismanagement, rogue actors, or cyber threats, it can result in dire consequences for
                            victims, compromise investigations, and hinder prosecutions. As a result, the safest
                            approach for each organization has been to keep all information private, with little or no
                            data exposed to any other actor. However, these relatively strict data practices can also
                            slow or hinder effective investigations and interventions, especially where there are
                            concerns for the safety of an individual. To date, anti-trafficking forces have lacked the
                            tools to overcome the fears around data privacy and securely share data to extract
                            information crucial to the fight for human dignity.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;" class="fw-lighter">Confidential Computing</h2>
                        <p>Intel and Edgeless Systems enabled Hope for Justice to take advantage of <a

                                Computing</a>—a technology that enables sensitive data to be processed confidentially,
                            out of
                            view from unauthorized software or system administrators.</p>
                        <p>Confidential Computing enables encrypted data to be processed in memory while lowering the
                            risk of exposing it to the rest of the system, thereby reducing the likelihood that
                            sensitive data will be compromised. In addition, it provides a higher degree of control and
                            transparency for users in multi-tenant environments where data can be isolated from other
                            privileged portions of the system stack.</p>
                        <p>With its focus on securing data and code during processing, Confidential Computing relies on
                            hardware- based controls such as the Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) enabled by <a

                                Software Guard Extensions</a> (Intel® SGX) enclaves. Intel SGX helps provide protection
                            for
                            applications and data independent of the operating system or hardware configuration. This
                            enables multiple organizations to collaborate on shared analyses and validate algorithms
                            while shielding their confidential information or regulated data from the other parties.
                            Intel SGX:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Helps protect against software attacks, even when other elements of the stack are
                                compromised.</li>
                            <li>Helps increase protection for secret content (personally identifiable information and

                            Project</h2>
                        <p>Intel, Edgeless Systems, and Hope for Justice built the Private Data Exchange (PDEx), a
                            powerful application to be offered to the global movement to end human trafficking. PDEx
                            enables the various organizations working against slavery to confidentially pool data
                            related to individual cases. After data from these groups is uploaded, the application
                            aggregates and analyzes it, then notifies appropriate agencies when relevant data matches
                            are uncovered.</p>
                        <p>Given the sensitivity of the data, maintaining high security and compliance is
                            mission-critical. To reap the benefits of collaboration, each organization must trust its
                            data will be kept confidential and private, and the integrity of that data will be ensured.

                                technology and globalization at a staggering scale and pace. Most trafficking is now
                                facilitated via the Internet and other digital technologies that pay little attention to
                                borders or jurisdictions. We cannot lose the technology race against human trafficking.
                                “That is why we are so pleased that the Private Data Exchange platform has the potential

                            <li><b>Perpetrator matching.</b>If the same person appears in multiple matches, they may be
                                involved in numerous cases of trafficking and be a serial offender or part of organized
                                crime. The appropriate group can begin an investigation or notify law enforcement.</li>
                            <li><b>Victim family name matching.</b>Discovering the same surname in multiple cases may
                                indicate that two or more family members have been trafficked separately. Linking the
                                two cases may accelerate rescue and help reunite the family.</li>
                            <li><b>Address matching. </b>If the same property keeps showing up in results, it may be
                                owned or operated by perpetrators or criminal organizations. This can be enough to
                                trigger an investigation.</li>
                            <li><b>Less obvious matches.</b>may not result in immediate investigations but can reveal
                                previously unseen trends. For instance, matches uncovering multiple cases of forced
                                labor in the construction industry might instigate outreach efforts toward construction
                                companies and local governance boards.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Edgeless Systems is a cybersecurity company based in Germany. The company’s technology
                            elevates the security of applications and workflows, enabling new and exciting forms of
                            trustworthy data processing. The company is built on the principles of open source, using a
                            community-driven approach to deliver confidential computing technology that is easy to use,
                            scale, and integrate.</p>
                        <h4 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">EGo</h4>
                        <p>EGo is a framework for building confidential apps in Go. Confidential apps run in
                            always-encrypted and verifiable enclaves on Intel SGX-enabled hardware. EGo simplifies
                            enclave development by providing two user-friendly tools:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>ego-go, an adapted Go compiler that builds enclave-compatible executables from a given
                                Go project while providing the same CLI as the original Go compiler.</li>
                            <li>ego, a CLI tool that handles all enclave-related tasks such as signing and enclave
                                creation.</li>
                        </ul>

                            initiative takes advantage of the industry-leading security capabilities delivered by Intel
                            SGX, the set of security features built into <a href="" style="color: #0068B5; text-decoration: underline  !important;text-underline-offset: .3rem !important;">3rd and 4th generation Intel® Xeon®

                                processors</a>. Designed specifically to support trusted computation, Intel SGX enables
                            developers to partition code into hardened enclaves. Data processed inside an enclave is not
                            accessible to other applications, the operating system, or hypervisor.</p>
                        <p>The combination of Edgeless Systems aggregation features and the power and functionality of
                            Intel technology opens new possibilities for organizations seeking to benefit from the
                            security of confidential cloud computing. Intel technology can serve as the critical link,
                            bringing together widely dispersed data so organizations can extract the previously
                            inaccessible value hidden in it.</p>
                        <p>Intel and Edgeless Systems are members of the Confidential Computing Consortium, a leading
                            force in advanced data security around the world.</p>
