                            Your computer’s central processing unit, or CPU, is the “brain” of your device. The power of
                            your CPU drives core operations. As one example, the CPU determines how many programs you
                            can have open successfully at one time. Most desktop PCs have a processor dedicated to the
                            speed and performance of the device. The more processing power a CPU has, the faster the
                            desktop PC will work.

                            Greater processing power also means your device can handle larger workloads and run
                            more-complicated tasks. Conversely, if a processor is inadequate to run all the tasks a
                            teacher may need in the classroom, programs may freeze or lock up. Most experts recommend a
                            larger CPU to ensure the greatest efficiency and performance.

                            The operating system, or OS, of your desktop PC is the “heart” of your computer. The
                            operating system manages all the hardware and software, files, memory, and peripheral
                            devices. It is also how you interact with your desktop PC because it runs the interface for
                            installing and running programs. While there are different operating systems, Windows and
                            macOS are two of the most familiar on the market.

                            A desktop PC monitor is the screen you use to operate your PC. Monitors are usually sold
                            separately from the tower unless you buy an all-in-one PC where the internal components are
                            housed within the main unit. When teachers need to run multiple windows, extra screen size
                            will make a difference. Most educators choose 24-inch or larger monitors. Screen size is the
                            diagonal width of the screen as measured in inches.

                            The monitor’s display resolution determines how sharp the screen will be visually.
                            Resolution is the number of pixels horizontally and vertically (e.g., 1,920 by 1,080). The
                            higher these numbers, the sharper the image on the screen.

                            short-term memory that helps your CPU process multiple tasks at once. The more RAM a desktop
                            PC has, the more processing capability it has to run complex or multiple functions. Basic
                            computing requires 4 GB or more; most desktop PCs come with 8 GB to 16 GB of RAM. It is
                            possible to upgrade the RAM over time if budget is a factor.

                            Storage is measured in gigabytes (GB) and terabytes (TB), with 1 TB equal to 1,000 GB.
                            Desktop PC storage typically starts at 500 GB to 1 TB, which is adequate for the average
                            user. Teachers today can use cloud storage services, external hard drives, and USB sticks

                            computer’s performance. This is because the GPU processes data from the CPU and shows it
                            visually on your monitor. If your GPU doesn’t have enough power, it will show in low-quality
                            graphics. This will impact visual tasks, including streaming, video editing, and graphic
                            design.

                            An advantage that desktop PCs offer is that their housing is larger to fit more-powerful
                            components. Additionally, the tower delivers the cooling needed to balance the power draw
                            and heat that a robust GPU will generate.

                            A more-robust GPU delivers more bandwidth in memory, a higher pixel rate, and increased
                            texture mapping. Texture mapping is the use of images or patterns converted to graphics so
                            they have greater realism visually. Generally speaking, the more memory a GPU has, the more
                            visual detail it can process.

                            Most desktop PCs include a built-in webcam as part of the system. All of the software and
                            drivers are installed, so the webcam is ready to go as soon as the computer is powered on.
                            Nearly every webcam can capture and stream basic video.

                            To see the quality of video a webcam can process, look at the megapixel count. The average
                            resolution for standard video is at least 640 pixels by 480 pixels. High-definition (HD)
                            video needs a webcam that handles 1,600 pixels by 1,200 pixels. The higher the megapixel
                            count, the better the picture quality. Most webcams are HD capable but can adjust to record
                            in a lower resolution or switch from widescreen to standard. Note: If the monitor does not
                            handle HD images, even if your webcam does, the video will not display in HD.

                            make sure the webcam comes with a headset or built-in microphone for audio. If lighting
                            could be an issue when recording video, look to see that the webcam can handle low-light
                            sensitivity.
