                            Power</h2>
                        <p>Taneishi has conducted research on Deep Learning (DL) based disease analysis with medical
                            imaging, including chest X-rays, virtual screening of small molecules affecting molecular
                            targets, and the structural and functional changes of proteins. AI-based research in these
                            areas demands a large-scale computational platform, making AI accelerators vital.</p>
                        <p>“Since Transformers first presented in 2017 and attention mechanisms are recognized to be an
                            essential factor in deep learning, the former models based on a convolutional and recurrent
                            neural network architecture have been rewritten, even in areas outside natural language
                            processing,” says Taneishi. “This results in a significant expansion of computational
                            frameworks, leading to further demand for advanced DL computing performance.”</p>

                        <p>RIKEN hosts Hokusai Sailing Ship (HSS) as one of its large-scale shared computing platforms,
                            and HSS is optimized mainly for data science with no AI accelerator. Instead, the institute
                            has established its heterogeneous computing environment combining on-premises and cloud
                            infrastructures, wherein the cloud technologies of four major vendors run alongside Fugaku,
                            the Center for Computational Science’s supercomputer for general purpose applications, and
                            RAIDEN, the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project’s computer system for
                            AI-development.</p>
                        <h2 class="d_head">Superior Price Performance and Easier Model Porting</h2>
                        <p>Of the institute’s cloud-based computing resources, Amazon EC2 DL1 instances powered by <a
                                href="">Habana® Gaudi® AI processors</a> are of particular interest to Taneishi. These
                            instances feature eight Habana® Gaudi® AI processors, <a href="">3rd generation Intel® Xeon®
                                Scalable processors</a> with 96 vCPUs, 768GB of memory, a 400 Gbps bandwidth network,
                            and 4 TB of local storage. Habana Gaudi AI processors boast eight Tensor Processing Cores
                            (TPC), 32 GB of high-bandwidth memory, and ten integrated 100 GbE RDMA over Converged
                            Ethernet (RoCE) ports. The eight Gaudi devices on the DL1 instance are connected all-to-all
                            via these RoCE ports, providing excellent scaling efficiency. The AWS EC2 DL1 instances
                            provide up to 40% better price performance for training deep learning models compared to
                            current generation GPU-based EC2 instances.1</p>
                        <p>“Habana® Gaudi® AI processors enable both tensor operations and matrix multiplications on
                            hardware, delivering powerful performance by optimally compiling deep learning computational
                            graphs,” explains Taneishi.</p>
                        <p>Released in 2019 when Transformer had been adopted as a standard, these processors help train
                            Transformer models with brilliant efficiency. And the advantages of purpose-built DL
                            architecture among AI accelerators enable Gaudi-based solutions to provide exceptional price
                            performance and more than doubled training throughput compared to V100 GPUs at similar cost
                            for computer vision and NLP models.”</p>
                        <p>Using TensorFlow and PyTorch models with Habana Gaudi AI processors is easy with small script
                            rewrites required. As code changes with Habana® SynapseAI® SDK are minimal, developers can
                            switch AI selectors to match their computing resources, while leveraging existing scripts,
                            minimizing migration effort and costs.</p>
                        <p>“Using TensorFlow and PyTorch syntaxes allows us to work with AI accelerators without any
                            change, so we can effortlessly port Habana SynapseAI SDK-supported models and their
                            derivatives,” explains Taneishi. “We need to add a few lines of code to control the AI
                            accelerator, but no issue is found in compatibility in the process of data definition,
                            modeling, training, or inference. The greatest advantage for researchers is that we can use
                            highly cost-performant computers to try new models released through academic papers
                            immediately.”</p>

                            Structures, 18% Accelerated Classification of Disease Patterns from Medical Images2</h2>
                        <p>Using the Habana Gaudi AI processor, Taneishi examined deep learning training in two areas:
                            predicting the secondary structure of proteins with BERT-Large, a language model, and chest
                            X-ray disorder classification using CheXNet, a computer vision model.</p>
                        <p>To predict the secondary structure of protein, in the first stage of 3D structure prediction,
                            a DL model was trained with 20 amino acid residues constituting a family of proteins as
                            input in a database of predetermined protein structures, resulting in an inference of
                            secondary structure sequences. The test revealed that the Habana Gaudi AI processor took
                            only 4.6 seconds per iteration to train the model—22% faster than a V100 GPU’s 5.9 seconds
                            (see Figure 1).</p>

                        <p>The disorder classification using CheXNet input a dataset of 112,120 chest X-ray images from
                            30,805 patients to infer the type and location where symptoms such as pneumonia occur. The
                            Habana Gaudi AI processor took 859.1 seconds in an iteration, showing 18% faster training
                            compared to 1,047.7 seconds by a V100 GPU (see Figure 2). Habana Gaudi AI processors running
                            in parallel with distributed data also ensure lower overhead and higher scalability within a
                            single node.</p>

                        </h2>
                        <p>To advance the future of AI drug discovery, Taneishi is currently working to provide a deeper
                            understanding of 3D structural and functional changes caused by the existence of ligand
                            binding in protein, detecting these transformations by training AI models from molecular
                            dynamics (MD) trajectories identifying the distance between amino acid residues. In the
                            medical AI field, he is planning to advance studies in modeling with multi-modal data in
                            addition to medical imaging now that a huge amount of complex data—including electronic
                            medical records, medical images, genomes, and lifestyles of tens of thousands of patients—is
                            available.</p>
                        <p>Intel announced the 2nd generation Habana® Gaudi®2 AI processors in May 2022. The latest in
                            this family boasts enhanced computational efficiency, shrinking its process node to a 7nm
                            from 16nm and offering 24 TPCs, three times as many as its predecessor. The
                            second-generation processor also features 96 GB of memory, three times more than the first
                            generation, and considerable networking enhancements, with the number of GbE ports
                            increasing from 10 to 24. These improvements provide a massive performance boost, delivering
                            roughly 2X better performance in ResNet-50 training throughput compared to A100 GPUs4 and 3
                            to 4.7X better performance than the first-gen Gaudi.3</p>
                        <p>“The more developers choose Habana Gaudi and Gaudi2 AI processors, the more models and
                            frameworks are becoming available to provide support, eliminating the barriers to deploy
                            Habana Gaudi2 AI processors,” says Taneishi. “We are seeing the appearance of more powerful,
                            easy-to-use services for cloud environments, which I’m eager to try.”</p>
