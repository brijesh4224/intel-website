                                    <p class="V_pv pt-md-3" id="Basics">Like any powerful piece of PC hardware, the CPU
                                        generates
                                        heat when in operation and needs to be properly cooled to achieve maximum
                                        performance.</p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">As Mark Gallina, System Thermal & Mechanical Architect at Intel
                                        explains, “During normal operation, the transistors inside a CPU convert
                                        electrical energy into thermal energy (heat). This heat increases the
                                        temperature of the CPU. If an efficient path for that heat doesn’t exist, then
                                        the CPU will exceed its safe operating temperature.”</p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">But what’s the best way to keep your CPU operating at the ideal
                                        temperature? There are many ways to cool a processor, but most desktops and
                                        laptops use an air- or liquid-based cooler.</p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">We’re going to talk about liquid cooling vs air cooling: how they
                                        work, the pros and cons of each, and which might be right for your setup.</p>

                                            and both do essentially the same thing: absorb heat from the CPU and
                                            redistribute it away from the hardware.

                                        <p class="V_pv ">The heat generated by the processor itself is distributed to
                                            the metal lid of the CPU, called the Integrated Heat Spreader (IHS). The
                                            heat is then transferred to the baseplate of the CPU cooler. That heat is
                                            then distributed, either by liquid or via heat pipe, to a fan, where it is
                                            blown away from the cooler and eventually away from the PC.

                                            the motherboard, freeing up space for other components, such as RAM. These
                                            pipes deliver the energy in the form of heat to the thin metal fins that
                                            make up the heatsink. These fins are designed to maximize exposure to the
                                            cooler air, which then absorbs the heat from the metal. An attached fan then
                                            pushes the warm air away from the heatsink.

                                            options, but most fall into two categories: All-in-One (AIO) coolers, or
                                            custom cooling loops. We’ll mostly be focusing on All-in-One (AIO)
                                            coolers here, though the fundamental principles of how the liquid cools
                                            the CPU are the same in both.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Similar to air cooling, the process starts with a baseplate
                                            that is connected to the IHS of the CPU with a layer of thermal paste.
                                            This allows for better heat transfer between the two surfaces. The metal
                                            surface of the baseplate is part of the waterblock, which is designed to
                                            be filled with coolant.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">The coolant absorbs heat from the baseplate as it moves
                                            through the waterblock. It then continues to move through the system and
                                            upward through one of two tubes to a radiator. The radiator exposes the
                                            liquid to air, which helps it cool, and fans attached to the radiator
                                            then move the heat away from the cooler. The coolant then re-enters the
                                            waterblock, and the cycle begins again.

                                                air cooler might not be the best option. A low-profile air cooler or an
                                                All-in-One (AIO) with a small radiator could be a better fit. When

                                                tends to be quieter than the fan on a CPU heatsink. Again, this can
                                                vary, in that there are air coolers with fans specifically designed to
                                                reduce noise, and fan settings or fan selection can impact the amount of
                                                noise generated. Overall, though, liquid cooling tends to generate less
                                                sound, as the small pump is usually well insulated, and radiator fans
                                                tend to run at lower RPM (revolutions per minute) than those on the CPU

                                                conduction, allowing for reduced fan speeds (better acoustics) or higher

                                                process, liquid cooling is probably the best option.
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="V_pv ">Air coolers are quite good at relocating heat away from the
                                                CPU, but keep in mind that heat is then dispersed into the case. This
                                                can raise the ambient temperature of the system overall. Liquid coolers
                                                do a better job of relocating that heat outside of the system via the
                                                fans on the radiator.

                                        air cooling is an easy recommendation.
