                            Since its general release last September, <a class="b_special_a1" href="">Intel<sup>®</sup> Tiber<sup>™</sup> Developer Cloud</a> has become a widely-used platform for evaluating new Intel<sup>®</sup> hardware and deploying AI workloads. It is based on a scale-out infrastructure and open software foundation including <a class="b_special_a1" href="">oneAPI</a>, to support benchmarking workloads for evaluation and large-scale multi-node AI workload deployments required for AI model training. Seekr is a fast-growing AI startup that uses Intel Developer Cloud for LLM model training at scale.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-0">
                            During the past months, Intel Tiber Developer Cloud’s compute capacity for enterprise customers steadily increased with additional U.S. regions, new state of the art hardware platforms, and new service capabilities. Our bare metal as a service (BMaaS) offering now includes large-scale Intel<sup>®</sup> Gaudi<sup>®</sup> 2 (128 node) and Intel<sup>®</sup> Max Series GPU 1100/1550 clusters, virtual machines (VMs) running on Gaudi 2 AI accelerators, storage as a service (StaaS) including file storage, and Intel<sup>®</sup> Kubernetes Service for cloud-native AI/ML training and inference workloads.  Providing access to these multiarchitecture systems on the latest hardware is truly unique—today, no other cloud service provider provides this.

                            Enterprise marketers, advertisers, and decision-makers rely on content marketing strategies to reach their audiences and are constantly challenged in their quest to do so in a manner that builds contextual relevance, trust and credibility. Today, consumers of online content suffer from information overload, misinformation, hallucinations, and inappropriate content, eroding the trust that enterprise marketers seek. Even more importantly, it puts company reputation at risk by being associated with content or platforms that host at-risk content.

                            An issue facing brands and ad agencies today is finding brand-safe advertising opportunities in a media landscape that is increasingly complex and difficult to navigate. For example, in podcasting, first-gen audio tools created for this task were overcomplicated and unreliable—prone to false negatives and false positives, allowing keywords to trigger risk content ratings. SeekrAlign, an advanced brand safety and suitability analytics solution, is built on an LLM combining proprietary content evaluation and scoring capabilities to provide unprecedented visibility into thousands of podcasts—aligned with established standards in the content and advertising industry.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            SeekrAlign simplifies finding safe and suitable podcasts by marrying world-class engineering with innovative and transparent ratings, allowing brands to navigate with nuance so they can confidently grow their audio campaign with increased clarity and speed. It goes above and beyond the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM) brand safety and suitability floor and enables brands to safely reach a much bigger audience. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A unique feature of the SeekrAlign product is its patented Civility Score™, which tracks personal attacks, including those that may not register as hate speech under GARM, but are still hostile in nature. It allows the end user to overlay desired risk filters, including GARM, giving brands unparalleled control and transparency in the podcast industry. SeekrAlign has already evaluated more than 20 million podcast minutes and applied scoring, and this will increase 5x by the end of the year, far outpacing competitive offerings. Seekr has a growing list of leading brands using Align, including Babbel, Equativ, Indeed, MasterClass, SimpliSafe, and Tommy John, among others (source: Seekr).

                            Seekr has been using a regional colo provider to host a server fleet of GPU- and CPU-enabled systems. The self-managed compute infrastructure is used for AI LLM model development and supports SeekrAlign.

Intel GPUs and Gaudi 2 accelerators are leveraged to both train and serve at scale, large and medium size transformers. We saw improved performance both for model training and inference, when compared to other chips in the market. Specifically on LLM inference, the large memory capacity of the Intel Gaudi 2 accelerators and GPUs has allowed us to adjust workload-specific parameters, such as batch sizes. On the software side, the various Intel extensions and support of the PyTorch framework and Hugging Face models enabled us to seamlessly move our ML stack to Intel hardware.”</i></p>

                            As part of the following Intel Developer Cloud integration phase, Seekr is planning to leverage large-scale Gaudi 2 based clusters with our Kubernetes Service to train its LLM foundation model and add CPU and GPU compute capacity to grow its trustworthy AI service offering. For more details and insight on benchmarks comparing their on-prem system with Intel Developer Cloud, see this case study: <a class="b_special_a1" href="">Seekr: Building Trustworthy LLM for Evaluating and Generating Content at Scale</a>.
