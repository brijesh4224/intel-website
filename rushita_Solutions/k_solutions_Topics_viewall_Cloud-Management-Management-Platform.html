This stack bundles compute virtualization with VMware vSphere*, storage virtualization with VMware vSAN*, network virtualization with VMware NSX*, and cloud management and monitoring with VMware vRealize Suite*. All together, these VMware cloud management solutions give you a powerful, secure foundation for your Intel® Hybrid Cloud. Additional tools and services are available for multicloud management.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Intel and VMware have a strong history of working together to enable Intel platform optimizations into all products in the VMware Cloud Foundation stack. These result in capabilities like live database migration between private and <a href="">public cloud</a> infrastructure and unique configurations for specific use cases. In particular, Intel® technologies as part of the VMware vSphere* cloud virtualization platform help IT teams support new workloads while managing the complexity of their infrastructure.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1"><strong>High Performance on Intel® Xeon® Platforms</strong><br>
                            When running on <a href="">Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors</a>, VMware vSphere* provides an ideal IT infrastructure for hosting a full range of enterprise applications. With the combination of scalable performance, high availability, and security, you can enhance service levels, accelerate time to market, and deliver higher value at lower total cost.</p>
                            <p><strong>Cloud Security Management</strong><br>
                                VMware vSphere* integrates advanced security capabilities into the hypervisor. These cloud-based security capabilities are powered by machine learning and provide greater visibility, protection, and response times for security events.</p>
                                <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1"><strong>Support for Intel® Optane™ Technology</strong><br>
                                    Memory and storage solutions featuring <a href="">Intel® Optane™ technology</a> deliver faster end-to-end performance with greater data mobility and portability. VMware vSphere* natively supports Intel® Optane™ DC persistent memory. This allows users to run multiple workloads on a single physical machine, perform live migration of virtual machines across servers with different types of persistent memory, and apply the benefits of persistent memory to unmodified legacy workloads. Intel® Optane™ DC Solid State Drives breakthrough performance bottlenecks by delivering extremely high throughput at low queue depths, ideal for big data workloads.</p>
                                    <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">As cloud technologies evolve, Intel and VMware will continue working together to advance solutions in areas like 5G and IoT.
