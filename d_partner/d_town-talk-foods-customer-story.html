                            grocery chain Town Talk Foods recently implemented i3Di, an AI-based video analytics
                            platform from PM AM Corporation.</p>

                        <p></p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Challenge </h2>
                        <p><a href="">Town Talk</a> is a long-standing family-owned chain of grocery stores in Texas. As
                            a licensed salvage retailer, they purchase groceries and restaurant supplies that would
                            otherwise not be salable under strict industry regulations—enabling them to offer extreme
                            discount prices to customers who enjoy hunting for bargains in their constantly changing
                            inventory.</p>
                        <p>Grocery retailers face a continual challenge from their online counterparts, with customers
                            having to choose between the convenience of purchasing online and the hands-on shopping
                            experience of a brick-and-mortar store. Online retailers benefit from the use of data
                            analytics to optimize their product and price mix and stay ahead of the competition.</p>
                        <p>In Town Talk’s 30,000-square-foot store in Arlington, Texas, sales were flat and
                            profitability was marginal, despite a growing local population. Town Talk needed insight
                            into in-store visitor patterns in order to optimize their product and price mix and attract
                            more customers.</p>

                                        <p>“We believe that in order to manage, one needs to measure. PM AM’s
                                            ML/AI-powered video analytics solution is one such initiative in this
                                            direction for the retail world. Intel’s technical help, testing environment,
                                            and partner network enabled us to deploy this solution in 60 days. Without
                                            Intel, it probably would have been more like six months.” —Pankaj Kumar, CEO

                        <p>Town Talk partnered with <a href="">PM AM Corporation</a>, a global information technology
                            company headquartered in Dallas, Texas, to deploy <a href="">i3Di</a>, an AI-based video
                            analytics platform whose name stands for “in-store three-dimensional insights.” By combining
                            demographic data with information about shopper location and shelf contents, i3Di delivers
                            near-real-time insights about shopping behaviors, buying preferences, outage notifications,
                            and demand forecasting.</p>
                        <div class="d_img">
                            <img src="/img/darshan_image/img698.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <p>Video cameras were installed around the store, focused on high-traffic areas such as the
                            produce, freezer, and snack aisles, as well as checkout counters. The cameras provided 100
                            percent coverage on the entry and exit and about 50 percent coverage elsewhere. Signs
                            alerted customers to the presence of video monitoring. </p>
                        <p></p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">How it Works</h2>
                        <p>The solution uses video data from smart cameras and in-store closed-circuit TV cameras. <a
                                href="">Intel® RealSense™ cameras</a> combined with integrated compute modules provide
                            the stereo-depth inferencing capabilities needed to identify shelf outages.</p>
                        <p>An on-premises server uses an <a href="">Intel® Xeon® E2 processor</a> and <a href="">Intel®
                                Movidius™ Myriad™ X VPU</a>, an ultralow-power VPU featuring a dedicated hardware
                            accelerator for deep neural network inference, which enables AI-based video processing for
                            movement detection and facial recognition in near-real time. For privacy and security
                            reasons, i3Di does not store shoppers’ images or personal data from video feeds.</p>
                        <p>The on-premises server is synced every 15 minutes with a cloud server running i3di on
                            Microsoft Azure. A dashboard gives store management insights based on data gathered by i3Di.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Software Development</b></p>
                        <p>The AI inference solution was optimized with the <a href="">Intel® Distribution of the
                                OpenVINO™ toolkit</a>. AI inference models included with the toolkit allow i3Di to
                            identify shoppers’ ages, sex, moods, and movement patterns.</p>
                        <p>The PM AM development team used <a href="">Intel® DevCloud</a> as a testing environment.
                            Along with access to Intel technical experts, this helped them analyze and optimize AI
                            models to make them more applicable and effective.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Insights</h2>
                        <p>i3Di provided Town Talk management with a number of actionable insights:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Shopper demographics. The retailer’s marketing agency had focused most of its marketing
                                spend on women and baby boomers. However, i3di revealed that over half of Town Talk
                                shoppers were actually men or millennials, while only a tiny fraction were baby boomers.
                                This revelation is helping the retailer optimize spending on online and in-store
                                advertising.</li>
                            <li>Customer journey maps. i3Di helped Town Talk map the typical customer path through the
                                store for different demographics and hours, allowing the retailer to identify the top
                                three most-visited areas of the store and to optimize merchandising in those areas.</li>
                            <li>Hours of operation. By customer request, Town Talk had extended its hours to 9 p.m. But
                                i3Di’s analysis showed that very few customers shopped after 7 p.m., amounting to less
                                than 2 percent of revenue. This knowledge enabled the retailer to optimize staffing by
                                refocusing on the hours of greatest customer demand.</li>
                            <li>Inventory outages. i3Di’s hour-by-hour monitoring of shelves in high-traffic areas
                                revealed times when shelves were bare, enabling the store to accelerate restocking.</li>
                            <li>Footfall projections. i3Di can forecast the number of visitors at any given time with a
                                high degree of accuracy (+/- 5 percent) so that Town Talk can ensure the store is always
                                adequately stocked.</li>

                        <p>With i3Di on board for six months, Town Talk was able to achieve 2021 sales targets with two
                            months left to go in the year.1 Town Talk CEO Tom Brown identifies i3Di as one of the main
                            reasons for this accomplishment. Town Talk plans to extend the i3Di solution to their other
                            stores and to explore additional use cases:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Implementation of total video coverage would enable heat mapping. Heat maps show at a
                                granular level which parts of the aisle attract customers of different demographics.
                                Benefits include valuable feedback on new product launches, data to drive a more
                                effective planogram, and stronger negotiations with manufacturers for shelf space and
                                placement.</li>
                            <li>Outage tracking ability can be used to validate service level agreements with
                                manufacturers, offering leverage in negotiations and the potential for sharing the
                                solution cost.</li>
                            <li>Beacon technology can serve targeted in-store ads and promotions to customers with the
                                store’s app on their phones.</li>
                            <li>Features can be integrated with the point-of-sale system for insights such as basket
                                size and total spend for various demographics.</li>
