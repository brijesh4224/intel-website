                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">What Is an Industrial Robotic Arm? </h2>
                        <p>From manufacturing to automotive to agriculture, industrial robotic arms are one of the most common types of robots in use today.</p>
                        <p>Robotic arms, also known as articulated robotic arms, are fast, reliable, and accurate and can be programmed to do an infinite number of tasks in a variety of environments. They are used in factories to automate execution of repetitive tasks, such as applying paint to equipment or parts; in warehouses to pick, select, or sort goods from distribution conveyors to fulfill consumer orders; or in a farm field to pick and place ripe fruits onto storage trays. And as robotic technologies develop and industrial environments become more connected, the capabilities of robotic arms expand to enable new use cases and business operation models.</p>
                        <p>In the past, a robotic arm required teaching to perform narrowly defined tasks, such as picking a single type of object from a precise location with a specific orientation. Robots were not able to identify a particular type of object among many, determine an object location with some tolerance (area rather than exact position), or adjust the grasp based on object orientation.</p>
                        <p>Today, thanks to devices such as <a href="">Intel® RealSense™ high-resolution depth cameras</a>, powerful CPUs and GPUs, and AI technologies such as the <a href="">Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit</a>, robotic arms are augmented with the sensing and intelligence to perform new tasks. These smart, vision-augmented robots can detect objects in their surroundings, recognize them by types, and manipulate them accordingly. These capabilities allow robots to operate more accurately and more consistently, and safer and faster than before. They also expand the range of tasks that robots can accomplish.</p>
                        <p>With these advancements in machine vision, AI and network technologies, robotic arms can now see, analyze, and respond to their environments while transmitting valuable data and insights back to facility and business management systems. One area that benefits from this transformation is equipment (robot included) maintenance. The robot can compute data at the edge or transmit it to a server or the cloud for remote monitoring. This process enables predictive maintenance, which in turn helps reduce maintenance costs while improving machine uptime.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">The Benefits of Industrial Robotic Arms</h2>
                        <p>Businesses can realize several benefits from industrial robotic arms:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Improved safety.</b>Robotic arms help keep workers safe by operating in environments that are hazardous and executing tasks that present high risk of injury to humans.</li>
                            <li><b>Improved efficiency and productivity.</b>Robotic arms can operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week without fatiguing, allowing businesses to keep production, inspections, or other tasks going continuously to increase output.</li>
                            <li><b>Enhanced precision.</b>By their very nature, robotic arms perform more consistently and accurately than humans for tasks that require extreme precision or consistency.</li>
                            <li><b>Greater flexibility.</b>As business priorities change, robotic arms can easily be repurposed for new activities or mounted onto different platforms, such as <a href="">autonomous mobile robots (AMRs)</a>, a stationary assembly line platform, or wall or shelf, as needed.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p></p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Industrial Robotic Arm Components</h2>
                        <p>Robotic arms, aptly named because they resemble a human arm, are typically mounted to a base.</p>
                        <p>The arm contains multiple joints that act as axes that enable a degree of movement. The higher number of rotary joints a robotic arm features, the more freedom of movement it has. Most industrial robotic arms use four to six joints, which provide the same number of axes of rotation for movement.</p>
                        <p>In addition to rotary joints, robotic arm components include the robot controller, an end-of-arm tool, actuators, sensors, vision systems, power systems, and software components.</p>
                        <p>Take a deeper look at a robotic arm in the graphic below:</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <div class="d_img">

                        </div>
                        <p></p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Robotic Arm Applications</h2>
                        <p>One of the key advantages of industrial robotic arms is their versatility for supporting multiple applications—from the simplest to the most complex jobs in the safest or harshest environments. Automating these types of tasks not only removes human workers from possibly hazardous situations, but it enables those workers to take on high-value tasks such as interfacing with customers.</p>
                        <p>Here are some of the most common ways manufacturers are using robotic arms today:</p>
                        <p><b>Palletizing</b></p>
                        <p>Robotic arms can be used to automate the process of placing goods or products onto pallets. By automating the process, palletizing becomes more accurate, cost-effective, and predictable. The use of robotic arms also frees human workers from performing tasks that present a risk of bodily injury.</p>
                        <p><b>Material Handling</b></p>
                        <p>Material-handling robotic arms can help create a safe and efficient warehouse by ensuring goods and materials are properly stored, easy to find, or transported correctly. Automating these processes can help accelerate the delivery of goods to customers, prevent workplace accidents, and improve the efficiency of a facility.</p>
                        <p><b>Welding</b></p>
                        <p>Welding is a task that can be performed by robots in advanced industrial settings such as automotive manufacturing. Given its critical impact on product quality, welding is an excellent candidate for advanced robotics with vision and AI augmentation for inline quality inspection.</p>
                        <p><b>Inspection</b></p>
                        <p>Performing quality inspection is typically completed at the end of a production line, which delays the detection of production quality issues. By enhancing robots with vision and AI systems, businesses can benefit from real-time inspection, helping to reduce waste and downtime.</p>
                        <p><b>Pick and Place</b></p>
                        <p>Pick-and-place robots are typically used in modern manufacturing and logistics. They are equipped with advanced machine vision systems to identify an object, grasp it, and move it from one location to another —quickly and efficiently— to increase speed of production and distribution of goods.</p>

It can feature between two and 10 rotary joints that act as axis points and enable movement. Each additional joint or axis allows for a greater degree of motion. The end of a robotic arm is often fitted with a manipulator, often called a gripper, that enables it to carry out a specific task.</p>
