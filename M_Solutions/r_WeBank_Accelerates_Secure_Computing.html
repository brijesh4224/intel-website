                            to effectively enhance the application efficiency of Artificial Intelligence (AI). However,
                            for data security and privacy protection considerations, the shared modeling of multisource
                            data requires more efficient and safer privacy computing solutions. To this end, WeBank,
                            which has been focusing on exploring and promoting federated learning, uses the leading FATE
                            (Federated AI Technology Enabler) open-source platform to help users quickly build federated
                            learning solutions. </p>
                        <p class="my-3">Homomorphic encryption (HE) is a commonly used privacy technology in federated
                            learning. HE enables computation directly on the encrypted data, without use of a secret
                            key. HE thereby ensures data security, though at a significant computational overhead
                            compared to unencrypted computation. In order to improve the computational efficiency of the
                            solution, WeBank partnered with Intel to accelerate the modular exponentiation operation of
                            Partial Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) by using the multi-buffer functions provided by Intel®
                            Integrated Performance Primitives Cryptography (Intel® IPP-Cryptography) library. Enabled
                            for the 1-socket and 2-socket server-oriented 3rd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors, with
                            the Integer Fused Multiply-Add (IFMA) instruction set newly added by Intel® Advanced Vector
                            Extensions 512 (Intel® AVX-512) at its core. By doing so, the overall operating efficiency
                            of federated learning solution based on the FATE framework was improved significantly. So
                            far, this optimization solution has been successfully tested and verified, and it is planned
                            for rollout to users. This will help users improve the efficiency of federated learning

                        <p>With algorithms becoming increasingly sophisticated and computing power continually enhanced,
                            a growing number of commercial AI applications have gained momentum in various industries.
                            In the financial industry, for example, some banks are managing credit risks through
                            AI-based intelligent risk control models, to reduce the rate of their non-performing loans.
                            However, this requires the support of abundant and rich sourced data for such AI
                            applications to yield better efficiency.</p>
                        <p>Multi-source data collaboration and sharing are by no means easy. On the one hand, when it
                            comes to business sensitive information, most organizations are very cautious when it comes
                            to data sharing. Even for different departments in the same organization, information
                            transfer requires multiple levels of approval. On the other hand, data security and privacy
                            protection have drawn increased public attention. This brings ever increasing scrutiny to
                            data security issues during the interaction, transfer, and aggregation of multi-source data.
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore, the AI teams in every organization are seeking privacy computing solutions with
                            higher security and higher efficiency. This enhances multi-source data collaboration when

                            in Partial Homomorphic Encryption with Multi-Buffer Function</h2>
                        <p>Homomorphic encryption is one of the most commonly used privacy technologies in federated
                            learning. The so-called homomorphism means that through a certain encryption method,
                            computation performed on the encrypted data will, when decrypted, yield the same result as
                            the computation performed on the unencrypted data. As illustrated in Figure 2, assuming
                            original data A and B came from Party X and Y of federated learning, respectively. Both
                            parties plan to obtain result C through collaborative computing, but neither party wants the
                            counterparty to know its result. In a federated learning environment that uses homomorphic
                            encryption, data A and B can be encrypted separately and perform the operations in the
                            encrypted environment, and the obtained result can be decrypted to get C. Neither party X
                            nor party Y can see each other’s the original data during the computing process, as the
                            whole collaborative computing process has been conducted in an encrypted environment.
                            Therefore, the security of the original data is guaranteed.</p>
                        <p>Here is the typical workflow for homomorphic encryption protocol-based federated learning:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Key:</b>Public keys are generated by an arbiter and distributed to each party.</li>
                            <li><b>Encryption:</b>Encrypt each party’s original data and upload it to the federated
                                learning environment.</li>
                            <li><b>Operation:</b>To perform operations (e.g., training a model) on encrypted data in a
                                federated learning environment.</li>
                            <li><b>Decryption:</b>The resulting optimization model is returned to participants, and then
                                decrypted.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The process of training a model through federated learning using homomorphic encryption
                            requires not only key generation but also encryption and decryption procedures. All kinds of
                            calculations required by the model itself (such as gradient computation) need to be
                            performed in an encrypted environment as well. Based on the encryption strength, the length
                            of integer precision after encryption varies from 1024 bits to 4096 bits, requiring a
                            significant amount of computing resources.</p>
                        <p>Homomorphic encryption has sustainable and distinct advantages among all sorts of common
                            privacy technologies. However, its high computational complexity leads to enormous computing
                            and time resources overhead for users. As a result, when deploying federated learning
                            solutions, users need to purchase more server resources and spend longer modeling time. This
                            can lead to increased cost and reduced efficiency. For an optimal solution, users need to
                            weigh security against computational complexity, and make a trade-off between homomorphic
                            encryption and other privacy technologies.</p>
                        <p>For this reason, many users prefer a partial homomorphic encryption solution, which has lower
                            computing overhead than leveled or fully homomorphic encryption. But even so, the entire
                            encryption process can be extremely time-consuming if there are hundreds of millions of
                            dataset samples involved in training a model.</p>
                        <p>To meet the practical needs of different business scenarios, WeBank plans to further
                            accelerate the Paillier algorithm-based partial homomorphic encryption in its FATE
                            framework. Working with Intel, WeBank identified that modular exponentiation is required
                            during the processes of key generation, encryption/decryption, and the
                            multiplication/addition operation of the encrypted data in partial homomorphic encryption,
                            as shown in the encryption/decryption process below:</p>
                        <p>Encryption: Computing Ciphertext c = gm rn mod n2</p>
                        <p>Decryption: Computing Plaintext m = L(cλ mod n2) × μ mod n</p>
                        <p>In the formulas above, encryption and decryption require 1 and 2 modular exponentiation
                            operations, respectively.</p>
                        <p>Simply put, the modular exponentiation operation is XY mod c. Although the computing itself
                            is not complex, as is described above, the data in a partial homomorphic encryption solution
                            is encrypted, and the length of integer precision reaches thousands of bits. Performing
                            modular exponentiation on such large numbers consumes big amount of computing resources.
                            Typically, modular exponentiation operations can account for a large portion of the cost of
                            the entire compute pipeline.</p>
                        <p>The FATE framework by default adopts the open-source mathematical operation library, GNU MP
                            Bignum Library (GMP), to perform the modular exponentiation operation. Although the GMP
                            library can support arbitrary-precision mathematical operations, it still uses “serial”
                            computing requests, even if the length of the data involved in the operation reaches
                            thousands of bits.</p>
                        <p>From Intel’s perspective, this has a huge room for optimization. The new Intel AVX-512 IFMA
                            instruction set integrated into the 1-socket and 2-socket server-oriented 3rd Gen Intel Xeon
                            Scalable Processors provides support for Intel IPP-Cryptography library, which brings an
                            additional function that implements generalized modular exponentiation operation.</p>

                            64-bit integer processing simultaneously. The newly added IFMA subset in the 1-socket and
                            2-socket-oriented 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable Processors enables the processors to perform
                            fused integer multiplication and addition, thereby significantly improving computation
                            efficiency. Using Intel AVX-512 IFMA, the Intel IPP-Cryptography library can initiate
                            concurrent 8 parallel computing requests to the processors through the multi-buffer function
                            mbx_exp _mb8() in the modular exponentiation operation, as shown in Figure 3. There is a
                            significant improvement in the computing efficiency of the modular exponentiation operation
                            through the change in computing request methods from serial to parallel, leading to
                            improvements in the overall computing performance of partial homomorphic encryption using
                            modular exponentiation.</p>

                            Dramatic Reduction in Deployment Cost
                        </h2>
                        <p>Intel and WeBank jointly conducted multi-faceted verification tests, to verify the
                            performance improvement of enabling the multi-buffer function provided by Intel
                            IPP-Cryptography under the partial homomorphic encryption in the FATE framework.</p>

                            Comparison).</i>
                        <p>The test result is shown in Figure 4. By using the multi-buffer function provided by Intel
                            IPP-Cryptography library, the performance of the modular exponentiation operation needed by
                            the partial homomorphic encryption algorithm has substantial improvement in the various
                            lengths of integer precision, compared to the original GMP library. Notably, the performance
                            increased 4.7X when the length of integer precision is 2048 bits.</p>
                        <p>The substantial increase in performance implies that users require fewer server resources
                            when deploying partial homomorphic encryption for federated learning solutions, thereby
                            effectively reducing the overall TCO. At the same time, thanks to the performance increase
                            of 1-socket and 2-socket server-oriented 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable Processors, users can
                            double their productivity when this is used as the computing platform for their federated
                            learning solutions, thereby doing more with less.</p>

                        <p>Facing the future, WeBank and Intel will continue to team up and collaborate in the following
                            aspects and promote the FATE framework to provide powerful capability support for users to

                            <p>It is worth mentioning that Intel provided a fully homomorphic encryption acceleration
                                library with its open-source project Intel® Homomorphic Encryption Acceleration Library
                                (Intel® HEXL). Bottlenecks in the computation of encrypted data in the solutions can be
                                optimized and eliminated by Intel HEXL, through the implementation of various
                                functionalities such as forward and inverse negacyclic Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT),
                                element-wise vector--vector modular operations. All these functionalities are being
                                implemented efficiently using the Intel® AVX-512 IFMA Instruction Set. With increasing

                        <p>Federated learning-based smart healthcare not only empower less capable hospitals to provide
                            high-quality medical testing results and attract more patients, it also assists physicians
                            in diagnosis reduces their workloads. At the same time, localized treatment can also
                            alleviate the burden on patients and their families.</p>
                        <p>Taking stroke detection as an example, by introducing horizontal federated learning,
                            hospitals with fewer patients can increase the testing accuracy by 10%~20% while maintaining
                            patients' privacy, compared to using only the hospital's patients as training samples2. The
                            accuracy of the model will increase with the increasing number of the hospital's case
                            samples added into the federated learning training. Taking China's nearly 2 million patients
                            who receive allopathic medical treatment (strictly limited to those receiving cross
                            provincial medical treatment) as an example, it is estimated that 200 million RMB in savings
                            can be achieved annually for the pre-disease confirmation phase by covering 10% of the
