                        <p>Companies want to focus on their business, not on the daily chores of server and IT
                            management. From its three data centers in Germany, myLoc applies its 20 years of experience
                            to offer its customers colocation, managed hosting, server hosting and private cloud
                            services—based on Intel® technology. This offering enables customers to keep control of
                            their data while also benefitting from reduced costs.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Customers can maintain control of data and infrastructure while decreasing total cost of

                            <li>myLoc’s private cloud services are 39 percent less expensive than a leading hyper-scale
                                cloud service provider1</li>
                            <li><a href="">2nd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors</a> provide the
                                hardware-based security and
                                high performance myLoc’s customers demand</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Challenge</h3>
                        <p>While public cloud services are a popular choice for some companies, others want more control
                            over their data. For example, German companies with sensitive data often prefer that data
                            stays on German soil to more easily comply with the General Data Protection Regulation.
                            myLoc’s customers expressed a desire for a managed private cloud hosting option, where they
                            could have the advantages of the cloud while keeping full control of data security and
                            bare-metal infrastructure. myLoc sought an infrastructure solution that could provide
                            private cloud services at a price point that is competitive with hyper-scale public cloud
                            services, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>
                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p>myLoc recently launched its VIP - Private Cloud Solution in cooperation with HPE and Intel.
                            The solution runs on HPE ProLiant Gen10 DL360 servers with the Virtuozzo Infrastructure
                            Platform (VIP) OS and 2nd generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors. This hyperconverged
                            infrastructure (HCI) solution combines high performance, scalability and maximum data
                            protection in one balanced, fully managed service. myLoc’s customers expect to always have
                            access to up-to-date hardware, so it made perfect sense to use the latest Intel® processors
                            in the VIP Private Cloud solution. 2nd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors enable myLoc to
                            offer high performance at the same price compared to the previous-generation processor.2</p>
                        <h3>Results</h3>
                        <p>The VIP - Private Cloud Solution provides both cloud-based high performance and efficient
                            security features, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection, firewalls and
                            intrusion detection solutions (IDS)—all at a price that comes in about 39 percent lower than
                            a similar infrastructure hosted in the public cloud at a leading hyper-scale cloud service
                            provider.1 Customers appreciate the ability to keep close control over their data while
                            decreasing hosting and management costs.</p>
                        <h3>Designing a Cost-Effective, High-Performance Private Cloud</h3>
                        <p>An IDC study indicates that private cloud spending increased 28.2 percent from 2017 to 2018,3
                            and the global private cloud server market size is expected to reach $183 billion by 2025,
                            rising at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29.4 percent.4 Off-premises private
                            cloud—such as the VIP—Private Cloud Solution offered by myLoc—in particular, is seeing
                            strong growth, driven by customers’ desire to more easily comply with national and regional
                            data protection regulations.</p>
                        <p>The challenge for myLoc was to design a private cloud solution that could open up new
                            opportunities and attract enterprise customers. The solution must provide access to the
                            latest hardware performance and security innovations. Other considerations included keeping
                            costs to a minimum to maintain a competitive edge compared to public cloud service offerings
                            and choosing a scalable design that could quickly respond to increased performance
                            requirements.</p>
                        <h3>VIP - Private Cloud Solution Fits the Bill </h3>
                        <p>After evaluating several options, the myLoc team chose the 2nd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable
                            processor family as the powerhouse of the new private cloud solution. That decision was made
                            based on the processors’ excellent reliability as well as the ability to provide more cores
                            for the same price point as before. Using mainstream processor models that still include new
                            hardware security mitigation and fixes for a wide range of vulnerabilities was another
                            benefit. The new processors’ increased memory speed also helps myLoc customers that have
                            memory-hungry workloads.</p>
                        <p>The solution runs on the VIP virtualization software, which is a simple hyperconverged
                            foundation for private and open cloud that enhances resource utilization, reduces costs, and
                            delivers high server execution rate and accessibility. With software-based security features
                            built-in, VIP provides an easy-to-use management console that can support a private cloud
                            that ranges from a few servers to complex server farms with high-availability clusters,
                            firewalls and load balancers.</p>
                        <div class="k_img1 my-5">

                        <p>And the best part? myLoc’s private cloud customers enjoy all the benefits of private cloud at
                            a cost that is 39 percent less expensive than hosting a similar number of virtual machines
                            (VMs) at a leading hyper-scale cloud service provider.1</p>

                        <p>The VIP - Private Cloud Solution runs on the HPE DL360 ProLiant Gen10 server, which supports
                            the 2nd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor family with up to an 11 percent per-core
                            performance gain over first generation5 and with memory speeds up to 2933 MT/s. myLoc and
                            HPE have a long-term relationship; HPE ProLiant servers are an essential component of
                            myLoc’s solutions. These rack-optimized servers deliver performance, resiliency and
                            scalability for business-critical workloads. ProLiant servers are also considered the
                            world’s most secure industry-standard servers6 and provide an agile infrastructure that
                            enables software-defined intelligence through services such as HPE OneView, HPE InfoSight,
