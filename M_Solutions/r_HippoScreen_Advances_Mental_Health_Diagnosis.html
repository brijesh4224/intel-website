                        <p>Depression represents a major global health issue, posing significant hurdles in diagnosis
                            and treatment within the multifaceted landscape of mental health. Globally, an estimated 5
                            percent of adults,1 1.1 percent of adolescents aged 10-14 years, and 2.8 percent of
                            15-19-year-olds2 suffer from depression. This equates to millions of people worldwide who
                            are struggling with depression making it a significant public health concern.</p>
                        <p>Diagnosing depression is not a straightforward task and there is no universally applicable
                            procedure. This is because depression manifests differently in different people. While there
                            are clinical methods to diagnose certain cases of depression, these tools do not always
                            provide a complete picture of the individual’s mental health status. For the majority of
                            assessments, healthcare providers rely heavily on patients’ own descriptions of their
                            feelings and experiences. This can be challenging as it requires patients to accurately
                            articulate their internal emotional state, which can be particularly difficult for those
                            experiencing mental distress.</p>
                        <p>In order to address this challenge, HippoScreen, developed the Stress EEG Assessment (SEA)
                            System, leveraging the Intel® AI Analytics Toolkit and <a href="">Intel® oneAPI Base
                                Toolkit</a>, which
                            helps healthcare providers diagnose mental health conditions more accurately and in a timely
                            manner.</p>
                        <h2 class="fw-lighter">Addressing Challenges in Diagnosis and Treatment of Depression</h2>
                        <p>According to recent statistics, approximately 50 percent of individuals with mental health
                            conditions do not receive the proper diagnosis or treatment within the first year of seeking
                            help.3 This delay can have long-lasting consequences, as early intervention is crucial in
                            managing and improving mental health outcomes.</p>
                        <p>A significant hurdle is the scarce availability of mental health professionals, especially in
                            rural regions where specialized care is often limited. The demand for mental health
                            assessments significantly exceeds the supply due to an insufficient number of psychiatrists
                            and psychologists, resulting in long waitlists and diagnosis delays. Additionally, large
                            caseloads for existing professionals can impede their ability to provide swift evaluations
                            and accurate symptom interpretation.</p>

                        <p>Another challenge is ensuring that individuals receive an accurate diagnosis amid numerous
                            factors such as misreported symptoms or multiple co-occurring conditions. Mental health
                            conditions often have complex symptomatology that external factors like substance abuse or
                            physical illnesses could influence. To complicate matters further, some symptoms may overlap
                            across specific disorders making it challenging for healthcare providers to pinpoint an
                            accurate diagnosis promptly.</p>
                        <p>These challenges underscore the need for innovative solutions to improve accessibility and
                            shorten wait times for mental health assessments. Additionally, incorporating machine
                            learning algorithms into diagnostic procedures could aid clinicians by more efficiently
                            analyzing large data sets and providing personalized insights based on observed patterns
                            across similar cases.</p>
                        <h2 class="fw-lighter">Maximizing AI for a Better Mental Depression Diagnosis</h2>
                        <p>HippoScreen’s SEA system was designed to provide a solution to these challenges. The SEA
                            system helps healthcare providers diagnose mental health conditions more accurately. Unlike
                            traditional methods that rely solely on patients’ selfassessment, HippoScreen takes a unique
                            approach by using brainwave technology. This approach maximizes real-time behavior
                            processing to identify the user’s cognitive state through brainwaves analysis of the
                            individual. The SEA system combines an EEG amplifier for data capture and signal processing,
                            a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for managing the test process, and an AI algorithm for data
                            analysis. By analyzing 90-second segments of brainwave signals, SEA provides a numerical
                            evaluation index, which objectively and quantifiably represents the likelihood of an
                            individual experiencing depression.</p>

                            in data preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selections, and classifiers. To achieve
                            this, HippoScreen needed to address a few challenges that are also faced by other AI
                            solutions for healthcare. The challenges primarily encompassed the generalization of the AI
                            model to ensure its applicability in real clinical usages, the design of a well-controlled
                            test process to uphold the data quality, and the assurance that the AI model could handle
                            data variation, which is crucial for successful outcomes. As a result, locating the optimal
                            parameters and the perfect feature set within these algorithm combinations could take
                            several days. In this context, the enhancement of these algorithms’ efficiency is crucial,
                            and it could potentially be the key to achieving timely delivery of these optimized results.
                        </p>
                        <p>This is where Intel played a crucial role in aiding HippoScreen to improve efficiency and
                            build times of deep-learning models used in its brainwave AI based SEA system.</p>
                        <h2 class="fw-lighter">Improving Algorithm Efficiency and Diagnostic Accuracy with Intel</h2>
                        <p>HippoScreen was able to optimize their SEA solution and improve the efficiency, performance,
                            and accuracy of their deep learning models, while reducing the delivery times of critical
                            diagnostic results, by using Intel AI Analytics Toolkit and Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit.</p>
                        <p>HippoScreen’s development process incorporates a blend of various algorithms and models to
                            create a unique decision factor. Central to this process is the utilization of HippoScreen’s
                            proprietary algorithms designed specifically for their unique needs. In addition to their

                            This includes models such as SCCNet, EEGNet, and Shallow ConvNet. These sophisticated models
                            are designed to process vast amounts of information and identify patterns that may not be
                            apparent with traditional analysis methods.</p>
                        <p>To further enhance the system’s capabilities, traditional machine learning algorithms from
                            Intel’s scikit-learn are also incorporated. These algorithms, which include Kmeans, Support
                            Vector Classification, and Support Vector Regression, provide robust and proven techniques
                            for analyzing data. This diverse mix of algorithms and models is used to analyze EEG Data
                            features. The integration of these various approaches allows for a more comprehensive and
                            nuanced analysis, ultimately leading to the formulation of a unique decision factor. This
                            decision factor, born out of the interplay of proprietary algorithms, deep learning models,
                            and traditional machine learning algorithms, represents the culmination of HippoScreen’s
                            innovative approach to mental health diagnosis. This approach holds the promise of more
                            accurate and timely diagnoses, potentially improving treatment outcomes for countless
                            individuals.</p>
                        <p>Another key tool that has revolutionized HippoScreen’s deep learning process is the Intel®

                        <h2 class="fw-lighter">Delivering the Performance Boost for Timely and More Efficient Depression
                            Diagnosis</h2>
                        <p>HippoScreen’s SEA was able to achieve a <b>2.4x increase in performance4 </b>by maximizing
                            Intel® AI
                            Analytics Toolkit and Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit along with the power of Intel® processors
                            for AI workloads. This played a critical role in enabling HippoScreen’s SEA to achieve the
                            optimal performance threshold required to enhance efficiency and reduce the diagnosis time
                            significantly.</p>
                        <p>Overall, Intel’s AI tools and frameworks have been instrumental in helping HippoScreen’s SEA
                            reach its full potential with advanced analytics capabilities. HippoScreen utilized <a
                                href="">Intel®
                                VTune™ Profiler</a> to gain in-depth insights into the total logical CPU count and
                            software
                            thread count in both their own and Intel’s python* environment with different OpenMP
                            libraries. This deep-dive analysis was instrumental in understanding the system’s
                            performance and identifying areas for optimization.</p>
                        <p>In both HippoScreen’s and Intel’s python environment, Intel VTune Profiler made a
                            recommendation to reduce the thread count. This recommendation was based on the observation
                            that both cases involved thread oversubscription, a situation where more software threads
                            are assigned than the total logical CPUs, resulting in inefficient CPU utilization. By
                            following the recommendations, HippoScreen could adjust the thread count to strike a balance
                            between performance and CPU utilization. This adjustment process involved careful testing
                            and analysis to find the optimal thread count—the “sweet spot” where the performance was
                            maximized, and CPU utilization was minimized, resulting in <b>2x performance gain.4</b></p>
                        <p>Finding this balance was a significant achievement, as it allowed HippoScreen to optimize the
                            system’s performance without overtaxing the CPU. This not only improved the efficiency of
                            the system but also potentially extended the lifespan of the hardware by preventing
                            unnecessary strain on the CPU.</p>
