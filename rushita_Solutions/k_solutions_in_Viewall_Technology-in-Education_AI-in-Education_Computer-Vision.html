                        <h2 class="k_26px mt-5 fw-lighter pt-4">What Is Computer Vision?</h2>
                        <p>Computer vision is a type of AI that trains computers to emulate how humans see, make sense of what they see, and act on that processed and analyzed information. Organizations that use computer vision can achieve a variety of business outcomes, including streamlined processes, improved performance, enhanced customer experiences, and greater competitive differentiation in their market.</p>
                        <p>Computer vision is often used for tasks that are time consuming, error prone, or nearly impossible for humans to accomplish, such as defect and anomaly identification and classification, machine condition monitoring, automated medical imaging analysis, and disease detection. These types of tasks require organizations to monitor operations, processes, or other parts of the business from multiple touchpoints, creating an enormous amount of collected visual data from which insights must be extracted—often in near-real time—and acted upon.</p>
                        <h3><strong>How Computer Vision Is Used</strong></h3>
                        <p>Computer vision systems use machine learning and deep learning models to train the system to recognize aspects of an image or video and make predictions about them. Types of computer vision models include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Image classification</strong> for inspecting an image and assigning it a class label based on the content. For example, an image classification model can be used to predict which images contain a dog, cat, or angry customer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Image segmentation</strong> for identifying objects and extracting them from their background, such as isolating a tumor from surrounding brain tissue in X-ray results.</li>
                            <li><strong>Object detection</strong> for scanning images or videos and finding target objects. Object detection models commonly highlight multiple objects simultaneously and can be used for tasks such as identifying items on shelves for improved inventory management or anomalies in items on a production line.</li>
                            <li><strong>Object tracking</strong> for tracking movements of detected objects as they navigate in an environment. For example, object tracking can be used in autonomous driving to track pedestrians on sidewalks or as they cross the road.</li>
                            <li><strong>Feature extraction</strong> for isolating useful characteristics captured in an image or video and sharing them with a second AI algorithm, such as search and retrieve image matching. For example, feature extraction can be used to automate traffic monitoring and incident detection.</li>
                            <li><strong>Optical character</strong> <strong>recognition</strong> for extracting and converting text from an image into a format that a machine can read. This is often used in banking and healthcare to process important documents and patient records.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="k_26px mt-5 fw-bolder pt-4"><b>How Computer Vision Works</b></h2>
                        <h3><strong>The Role of Convolutional Neural Networks</strong></h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Computer vision systems use deep learning models from a family of algorithms known as <a href="#">convolutional neural networks (CNNs)</a> to guide image processing and analysis. These deep learning models analyze the RGB values embedded in digital image pixels to detect identifiable patterns. CNNs can be developed to evaluate pixels based on a wide range of features—including color distribution, shape, texture, and depth—and accurately recognize and classify objects.</p>
                        <h3><strong>Training Computer Vision Models</strong></h3>
                        <p>Before a computer vision system can be put to work, data scientists and developers must train the system’s deep learning model for its specific use case. This requires inputting large amounts of application-specific data that the model can use to recognize what it has been developed to identify. For example, for a computer vision application designed to recognize a dog, the model must first learn what a dog looks like. It does this by being trained on thousands, maybe even millions, of images of dogs of different breeds, sizes, colors, and characteristics.</p>
                        <p>Most commonly, training takes place in data centers or cloud environments. For especially complex training initiatives, GPUs and AI accelerators can be applied to expedite the process and better handle the increased number of parameters involved. Once the model has completed the training phase, it has the knowledge needed to interpret and infer information from digital images. The model may also be further fine-tuned or retrained over time.</p>
                        <p>It’s also important to note that those seeking to build computer vision solutions can use off-the-shelf, foundational models as starting points for fine-tuning to accelerate development times and avoid starting from scratch.</p>
                        <h3><strong>Deploying Computer Vision Models</strong></h3>
                        <p>Once trained, computer vision models can be deployed to computer systems to perform inference and interpret conditions in the field—continuously assessing image and video data to extract insights and information. While computer vision solutions can run inferencing workloads in the cloud or data center, many organizations today are exploring edge AI applications, where computer vision models run closer to where data is generated on lightweight, optimized edge hardware or embedded devices.<br>
                            Moving AI inferencing capabilities closer to the edge can offer several key benefits:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Increased speed and lower latency:</strong> Moving data processing and analysis to where it is generated helps speed system response, enabling faster transactions and better experiences that are vital in many computer vision applications.</li>
                                <li><strong>Improved network traffic management:</strong> Minimizing the amount of data sent over a network to the cloud can reduce the bandwidth and costs of transmitting and storing large volumes of data.</li>
                                <li><strong>Greater reliability:</strong> The amount of data that networks can transmit simultaneously is limited. For locations with subpar internet connectivity, storing and processing data at the edge improves reliability.</li>
                                <li><strong>Enhanced security:</strong> With proper implementation, an edge computing solution may increase data security by limiting data transmission over the internet.</li>
                                <li><strong>Privacy compliance requirements:</strong> Some governments, customers, or industries may require that data being used for computer vision applications remain in the jurisdiction where it was created. Edge computing can help businesses stay compliant with such rules and regulations.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <h2 class="k_26px mt-5 fw-bolder pt-4"><b>Get Started with Computer Vision</b></h2>

                                <p>Computer vision combines cameras, edge computing, cloud-based computing, software, and AI models to help systems “see” and identify objects. It uses deep learning to form neural networks that guide system image processing and analysis, helping to teach a computer to recognize aspects of an image or video and make predictions about them.

                                    Convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques enable deep learning inference for image classification and object detection. Once fully trained, computer vision models can perform object recognition; detect and recognize people, things, or visual details; and even track movement.</p>
