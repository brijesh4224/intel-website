                                            ensure
                                            that there are no loose or malfunctioning cables. If you are working with a
                                            prebuilt system, keep in mind that opening your PC can violate your
                                            warranty, and it might be a good idea to contact your system manufacturer
                                            for advice before proceeding.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Start by unplugging the cable that runs from your PC’s power
                                            supply to the outlet before doing anything else inside your computer. Also,
                                            be sure to disconnect any external peripherals, like keyboards, mice or
                                            external hard drives, and monitor cables that are plugged into your
                                            computer. USB devices or display connections cables can occasionally cause
                                            power issues, and if your PC boots without any plugged in, plug each one
                                            separately and test until you’ve found the problematic peripheral, and
                                            either try and boot without it or test with a replacement.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">If that doesn’t work, unplug your computer from the wall, and
                                            open your case to get access to your internal components. This process will
                                            vary depending on your case, so follow any appropriate documentation and
                                            instructions to get access to the inside of your PC.

                                        <p class="V_pv">After getting your case open, you’ll want to check all the
                                            connections from your power supply to the components in your PC, see if any
                                            are loose, and then reseat them if they are. If you have a modular PSU (a
                                            power supply where you choose the cables you want to use), also be sure to
                                            double-check that the cables are properly seated on the PSU side as well.
                                            After ensuring nothing is loose on either side, see if your PC powers on.

                                        <p class="V_pv">If that didn’t work, it’s time to unplug every power cable that
                                            is connected to your components. This includes the 24 pin and the CPU power
                                            cables connected to your motherboard, additional power cables running to any

                                            motherboard and CPU power cables, plug in your PC, and see if your system
                                            turns on, as indicated by fans spinning and the lights on your hardware

                                            that could be causing an electrical short. Common examples of this issue are
                                            motherboards that are screwed directly to the case without using the
                                            required standoffs, or Molex* connectors with errant pins making contact
                                            with the chassis. This is unlikely to be an issue if your PC is prebuilt,
                                            but it’s always worth looking out for and isn’t always obvious.

                                            successfully provides power to your motherboard. If it does, your previous
                                            PSU was likely the problem, and you can contact the manufacturer of the

                                                on properly. If your system still isn't reacting when the power button

                                                shutting down again, follow the steps below.</p>
                                            <p class="V_pv"><strong>POST and Beep Codes</strong></p>
                                            <p class="V_pv">Though it can be hard to pinpoint why your PC is failing to
                                                boot, there are built-in tests that can help. Power On Self Test (POST)
                                                codes and beep codes are visual and audio cues that your motherboard
                                                manufacturer uses to communicate the results of internal hardware tests.
                                                These signals can be very useful in determining any hardware issues that
                                                might be keeping your PC from turning on.</p>
                                            <p class="V_pv "> POST codes usually consist of two numbers that
                                                indicate at what point the system encountered a hardware issue in the
                                                process of booting, and this can often help identify the source of the
                                                problem. For example, if the POST code indicates a memory initialization
                                                error, you would know to start with troubleshooting your RAM. Many
                                                motherboards have a hexadecimal display that will display the code and
                                                provide insight into where to begin the diagnostic process. If your
                                                motherboard doesn’t have a built-in display, you can get a POST test
                                                card that installs into a PCIe slot and displays that code for you.
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="V_pv">Beep codes are the auditory equivalent of POST codes. When
                                                your PC powers up, assuming it does, you might hear a series of beeps.
                                                These audio signals have the same diagnostic functionality of POST codes
                                                — for example, three beeps might mean there was no video card detected,
                                                and you would want to start with reseating your GPU.</p>

                                                motherboard manufacturer uses a different system of codes. Check your
                                                motherboard documentation or search online for the codes your
                                                motherboard manufacturer uses to see if you can identify the issue you

                                            <p class="V_pv mb-0">Here’s how to do it:

                                                <li>Locate the two power switch headers on your motherboard.
                                                    These small headers are often labeled something like PWR_SW, with +
                                                    and - symbols. If the power button from your case is already wired
                                                    to these headers, you’ll need to remove those cables. Consult the
                                                    motherboard manual if you’re having trouble locating
                                                    the power switch headers, as the labelling can sometimes
                                                    be difficult to spot with the naked eye.</li>
                                                <li>Make sure the 4/8 CPU and 24-pin motherboard power cables are
                                                    connected and that the PSU is switched on and supplying power.</li>
                                                <li>Lightly touch a metal screwdriver to the two power switch header
                                                    pins, and the system will turn on if everything is connected
                                                    correctly. This process accomplishes the same thing as hitting the
                                                    power button on your case when properly connected, or using an
                                                    onboard power button on your motherboard.</li>

                                                your case is the problem. If your case has a reset button, you’ll find
                                                it’s wired to the reset switch headers near the power button headers.
                                                Try replacing the cables to your power button headers with those from
                                                the reset button. They operate in the same way, and if the problem is
                                                the power button in your case, wiring the reset button to the power
                                                switch headers might circumvent this issue.

                                            <p class="V_pv ">Of course, you’ll have to press the reset button instead of
                                                power button to turn your computer on, but it’s a useful temporary
                                                solution. Contact your case manufacturer for a more long-term solution.

                                                to start testing each piece of hardware individually. This is a little
                                                different than testing all of the power cables, as we did earlier. That
