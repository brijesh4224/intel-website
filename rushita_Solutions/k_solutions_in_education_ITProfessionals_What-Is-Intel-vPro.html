                        <h3 class="mt-5">Gain Professional-Grade PC Performance</h3>
                        <p>Setting your employees up for success starts by equipping them with powerful PCs that not only meet their work needs but also provide an enjoyable user experience.</p>
                        <p>PCs built on Intel vPro® are powered by Intel® Core™ processors, so users get the performance they need to fully take advantage of demanding business applications, tackling difficult workloads with ease.</p>
                        <p>For creative team members where high performance is critical, sales representatives out in the field talking to customers, or human resources professionals onboarding new employees, Intel vPro®-based devices powered by Intel® Core™ processors equip your employees with the computing power they need to excel at whatever they do.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">For example, with Intel vPro®-based devices paired with <a href="#">13th Gen Intel® Core™ processors</a>, your employees can experience better business application performance over the prior generation with up to 15 percent faster Microsoft Office productivity<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;as well as better productivity with up to 30 percent faster mainstream application performance compared to the current competitive offerings.<sup>7</sup></p>
                        <h4>Types of Intel vPro® Processors</h4>
                        <p>Intel vPro®-based devices are available with a broad range of Intel® processors, enabling you to choose the combination that best meets your business needs for power optimization, graphics performance, memory, form factor, and more.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Depending upon your end user requirements, Intel vPro® can be paired with select generations of <a href="#">Intel® Core™ processors</a>&nbsp;or, for powerful mobile workstations, paired with <a href="#">Intel® Xeon® W processors</a>.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Additionally, you can outfit your Intel vPro®-based devices with <a href="#">Intel® Core™ Ultra processors</a>&nbsp;that incorporate AI-enabled productivity enhancements and provide additional security and manageability features.</p>
                        <h3 class="mt-5">Boost PC Protection with Multilayer, Hardware-Based Security</h3>
                        <p>The security threat landscape is constantly changing. Additionally, the growth of the hybrid and remote workforce has introduced new complexities and potential attack surface vulnerabilities, making it more difficult for IT to protect PCs outside an organization’s firewall.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Intel vPro® is built to address these advanced security challenges with integrated, multilayer security features designed for dispersed fleets. Available exclusively on Intel vPro®-based PCs, <a href="#">Intel® Hardware Shield</a>&nbsp;adds out-of-the-box protections above and below the OS to help reduce the device’s attack surface, including AI-powered threat detection that actively monitors against attacks. Security integrated at the hardware level helps prevent malware injection, protect user log-in credentials, and keep applications and sensitive data secure; below-the-OS features help defend against firmware-based attacks. Additionally, PCs built on Intel vPro® Enterprise for Windows can be reached even if the OS is down, allowing your team to access devices that have been compromised regardless of where the device is located.<sup>8</sup> <sup>9</sup></p>
                        <p>With the multilayer security protections of the Intel vPro® platform available, you and your team can gain peace of mind knowing that intelligent security features are actively helping to protect users from malicious attacks and your business from breaches, all without bogging down productivity for the user or IT.</p>
                        <h3 class="mt-5">Get Complete Remote Management</h3>
                        <p>With hybrid work now being used as a strategic workforce policy, offices and employee devices are now anywhere employees choose to work. This can make it more costly and time-consuming for IT teams to monitor, manage, and protect PCs.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">To help IT simplify and streamline support in order to provide an improved end-user experience, the Intel vPro® platform provides modern hardware-based management capabilities via <a href="#">Intel® Active Management Technology (Intel® AMT)</a>. Intel® AMT, available on all devices built on Intel vPro® Enterprise for Windows, provides the advanced remote management tools IT teams need to manage a distributed fleet, enabling the ability to:</p>

                        <p>Stable, validated hardware helps to keep your business running and your users productive and can enable smoother fleet management and business continuity, allowing you to focus your IT resources on business growth and innovation.</p>
                        <p>The Intel vPro® platform delivers the latest PC platform technologies in one integrated and validated solution. We partner with OEMs and OS providers to conduct thousands of tests and feedback loops each year to certify that Intel vPro® platform-based PCs meet rigorous standards and are validated for business.&nbsp;This also means that Intel maintains corporate platform validation for multiple OS versions at a time, so IT can transition from one OS generation to the next on their own schedule. Our multistep validation process also helps ensure that the highest possible standards are maintained throughout the PC value chain, from Intel to OEM to IT to end user. This gives IT and end users the stability and reliability of a true business-class device.</p>
                        <p >A key component to the stability and reliability offered with Intel vPro® Enterprise for Windows PCs is the <a href="#" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline">Intel® Stable IT Platform Program (Intel® SIPP)</a>&nbsp;Intel® SIPP aims to keep hardware components consistent for 15 months from product launch, including the silicon on the motherboard, the design, and each physical component. IT can be confident in scaling out their organization, knowing they won’t have to worry about revalidation when supplying systems around the globe. In a 2021 survey of ITDMs, 90 percent of respondents said that Intel® support and add-on solutions enabled by the Intel vPro® platform were a significant part of their overall value gained.<sup>10</sup></p>
