                        <h2 class="mt-4 fw-lighter">Challenge</h2>
                        <p>Prior to 2017, Osaka University CMC resources were used by or both general purpose and
                            scientific computing. OCTOPUS was designed for computational science alone in traditional
                            simulation and modeling and emerging work at the time in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
                            machine learning (ML). Its heterogeneous architecture included Intel Xeon Scalable
                            processors and NVIDIA GPUs. After deployment, its usage increased rapidly. It has been a key
                            resource in supporting the new achievements of Osaka University researchers and students.
                        </p>
                        <p>“OCTOPUS is still an important component in researchers’ tools,” Dr. Susumu Date, Associate
                            Professor, Osaka University CMC stated. “But, by 2021, it saw 90 percent average
                            utilization, with many users waiting days in the queue for their work to start.”</p>
                        <p>Today, as a national university corporation, Osaka University and the CMC support a greater
                            array of researchers in academia and industry from around the country, plus students working
                            on projects. Additionally, AI, Internet of Things (IoT), High Performance Data Analytics
                            (HPDA), and use of shared data are increasingly crucial to expanding understanding and
                            breakthroughs in science. To support expanding research, the CMC will enable innovation and
                            greater interdisciplinary work across the sciences through shared data in a safe and
                            responsible manner. This capability plus the need for more capacity and performance and user
                            scalability led to the design and deployment in 2021 of SQUID (Supercomputer for Quest to
                            Unsolved Interdisciplinary Datascience).</p>

                        <h2 class="mt-4 fw-lighter">Solution</h2>
                        <p>SQUID was designed to explore unsolved data science problems using the latest techniques and
                            methods of computational science. For such a vision, SQUID, like OCTOPUS, required multiple
                            compute architectures.</p>
                        <p>“Some users will use different types of compute nodes in a combinational way,” Date added.
                            “Others will compare them. SQUID, like OCTOPUS, was designed with heterogeneity to
                            accommodate the needs of users.”</p>
                        <p>Built by NEC, SQUID comprises three different groups of compute nodes, totaling 1,598
                            servers:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                1,520 general-purpose HPC compute nodes, each with dual-socket Intel® Xeon® Platinum
                                8368 processors with Intel® Deep Learning Boost (Intel® DL Boost) for AI inference
                                acceleration</li>
                            <li>42 GPU nodes with dual-socket Intel Xeon Platinum 8368 processors, each with eight
                                NVIDIA A100 accelerators</li>
                            <li>36 vector nodes, each with NEC SX-Aurora TSUBASA Type 20A accelerators with
                                high-bandwidth memory</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>But additionally, SQUID needed much larger data capacity and management capabilities, extreme
                            security, many more petaFLOPS, and the ability to easily support more users.</p>
                        <h2 class="mt-4 fw-lighter">Five Key Challenges Addressed</h2>
                        <p>“Five challenges were explored in deploying SQUID: HPC and HPDA integration, cloud bursting,
                            a secure computing environment, tailor-made computing, and data aggregation,” explained
                            Date. “SQUID was designed around these five criteria.”</p>
                        <p><b>HPDA integration:</b> Users today have opportunity to use many types of computation for
                            different
                            purposes and use them in different ways, whether for simulation or analytics. HPDA has
                            emerged as an important tool for revealing insights in research, so it was important to
                            integrate both traditional HPC and HPDA in the design of SQUID, according to Date.</p>
                        <p><b>Cloud bursting:</b> Even with a much larger cluster, Osaka University CMC needed the
                            ability to scale quickly to meet the needs of various users in order to avoid long wait
                            times on the system as the user base grows. The answer was to build in the ability to burst
                            some workloads to the cloud when needed. Users have the choice to run either only on SQUID
                            or to burst to the cloud if necessary. A sophisticated NEC job scheduler can push jobs to
                            either Oracle Cloud Infrastructure or Microsoft Azure cloud to accommodate the needs of
                            users.</p>
                        <p><b>Secure computing:</b>Users have access to more data in a very secure environment, achieved
                            through collaborative development between NEC and Osaka University CMC. The environment
                            provides dynamic partitioning to isolate compute and networking for a particular group to
                            protect data and computation. Additionally, an experimental program is exploring how to use
                            sensitive, confidential data in on-premises repositories without moving data from storage.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Tailor-made computing: </b>Osaka University CMC supports Singularity containers to allow
                            users to create and run their projects in a tailor-made workspace. Users can build their
                            projects on a local desktop or laptop and transport the container file to SQUID where it
                            will run using the needed resources.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Data-aggregation: </b>Modern global research largely shares data generated by
                            supercomputing systems. Data generated by one project can be important to another endeavor.
                            Thus, SQUID was designed with the ability to aggregate and share data between researchers
                            across the planet.
                        </p>
                        <p>“We designed a data aggregation infrastructure named ONION (Osaka university Next-generation
                            Infrastructure for Open research and open innovatioN),” Date added. “It allows researchers
                            to share computing results with other researchers immediately after the computation
                            completes through a smartphone or local computing environment.”</p>
                        <p>ONION work s in conjunction with the Cloudian Object Storage HyperStore platform and
                            accommodates a variety of data access protocols to improve storage flexibility. For example,
                            S3-compatible IoT devices can be configured to aggregate their data onto the SQUID parallel
                            file system, so users can use that data in simulations.</p>
                        <p>The data aggregation infrastructure is built on Data Direct Networks (DDN) EXAScaler
                            appliances, providing 20 petabytes of hard disk storage and 1.2 petabytes of fast, NVMe
                            storage in a parallel file system.</p>
                        <p>Designed with these capabilities, SQUID now allows researchers across many fields to run
                            their jobs and share their data using one of the fastest clusters in the country.</p>
                        <h2 class="mt-4 fw-lighter">Result</h2>
                        <p>In addition to supporting university researchers, CMC provides SQUID resources to national
                            research projects through two programs. These projects are approved by the <a href="" style="color: #0068B5; text-decoration: underline  dashed !important;text-underline-offset: .3rem !important;"> High

                                Center for
                                Interdisciplinary Large-scale Information Infrastructures.</a></p>
                        <p>“Last year, 17 projects accepted by these two institutions were run on Osaka University CMC
                            resources,” Date said. “Eleven of those were completed on SQUID. These were related to
                            quantum chromodynamics (QCD), molecular dynamics, COVID-19, astrophysics, and others.”</p>
                        <p>One of the research groups in the university is using SQUID to explore the mixture of queues,
                            according to Date. “The group uses different compute nodes in a combinational way to take
                            advantage of different characteristics of the processors and accelerators in the nodes. The
                            effort is examining how to use heterogeneous compute nodes more effectively,” he concluded.
                        </p>
                        <p>Addressing the five challenges considered in designing SQUID was in response to how research
                            has turned more global. Scientists work in greater collaboration to achieve new insights and
                            breakthrough discoveries. SQUID supports the global research community with greater capacity
                            and a data aggregation/sharing infrastructure.</p>
                        <h2 class="mt-4 fw-lighter">Solution Summary</h2>
                        <p>Osaka University CMC needed to augment the resources of OCTOPUS, deployed in 2017, with
                            higher performance, greater capacity, and the ability to meet the needs of a growing
                            research community. NEC built the heterogeneous architecture cluster with 3rd Generation
                            Intel Xeon Scalable processors, GPUs, and vector accelerators, achieving over 16 petaFLOPS.
                            Its data aggregation infrastructure, built on DDN EXAScaler appliances and Cloudian Object
                            Storage HyperStore platform allows scientists to run their calculations and share data
                            immediately with others around the world. SQUID is a key resource for researchers in
                            academia and industry in Japan, enabling discovery and insight across multiple scientific
                            disciplines.</p>
