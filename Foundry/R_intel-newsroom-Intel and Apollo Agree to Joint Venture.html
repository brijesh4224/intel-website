                            <p>SANTA CLARA, Calif., and NEW YORK, June 4, 2024 – Intel Corporation (Nasdaq: INTC) and
                                Apollo (NYSE: APO) today announced a definitive agreement under which Apollo-managed
                                funds and affiliates will lead an investment of $11 billion to acquire from Intel a 49%
                                equity interest in a joint venture entity related to Intel’s Fab 34.</p>
                            <p>The transaction represents Intel’s second Semiconductor Co-Investment Program (SCIP)
                                arrangement. SCIP is an element of Intel’s Smart Capital strategy, a funding approach
                                designed to create financial flexibility to accelerate the company’s strategy, including
                                investing in its global manufacturing operations, while maintaining a strong balance
                                sheet.</p>
                            <p>Located in Leixlip, Ireland, Fab 34 is Intel’s leading-edge high-volume manufacturing
                                (HVM) facility designed for wafers using the Intel 4 and Intel 3 process technologies.
                                To date, Intel has invested $18.4 billion in Fab 34. This transaction allows Intel to
                                unlock and redeploy to other parts of its business a portion of this investment while
                                continuing the build-out of Fab 34. As part of its transformation strategy, Intel has
                                committed billions of dollars of investments to regaining process leadership and
                                building out leading-edge wafer fabrication and advanced packaging capacity globally.
                            </p>
                            <p>Under the agreement, the joint venture will have rights to manufacture wafers at Fab 34
                                to support long-term demand for Intel’s products and provide capacity for Intel Foundry
                                customers. Intel will have a 51% controlling interest in the joint venture. Intel will
                                retain full ownership and operational control of Fab 34 and its assets. The transaction
                                is designed to enhance the company’s strong balance sheet with capital at a cost below
                                Intel’s cost of equity. The investment in the joint venture is expected to be treated as
                                equity-like from a ratings perspective.</p>
                            <p>
                                “Intel’s agreement with Apollo gives us additional flexibility to execute our strategy
                                as we invest to create the world’s most resilient and sustainable semiconductor supply
                                chain. Our investments in leading-edge capacity in the U.S. and Europe will be critical
                                to meet the growing demand for silicon, with the global semiconductor market poised to
                                double over the next five years,” said David Zinsner, Intel CFO. “This transaction
                                allows us to share our investment with an established financial partner on attractive
                                terms while maintaining our strong investment-grade credit rating.”
                            </p>
                            <p>Apollo Partner Jamshid Ehsani added, “Apollo is pleased to enter into this joint venture
                                with Intel. This highly strategic capital transaction is among the largest private
                                investments of its kind and showcases Apollo’s ability to provide creative, scaled
                                capital solutions to leading corporations and infrastructure, and to contribute to
                                supply chain resiliency. It also underscores our role as a trusted financing partner,
                                leveraging private capital to help build the New Economy, including next-generation AI
                                technology which will require major investments in sustainable power generation, data
                                centers, foundries and semiconductor capabilities.”</p>
                            <p><strong>Transaction Details</strong></p>
                            <p>Construction of Fab 34 is largely complete, and high-volume manufacturing of Intel® Core™
                                Ultra processors on Intel 4 technology began there in September 2023. The ramp of
                                Granite Rapids, Intel’s next-generation data center product on Intel 3 technology, is
                                also well underway.</p>
                            <p>The joint venture will manufacture wafers for sale to Intel on a cost-plus-margin basis.
                                Under the agreement, Intel is required to finish the build-out of Fab 34 and purchase
                                wafers from the joint venture for itself and external customers, with minimum volume
                                commitments for its wafer demand following the substantial completion of the facility.
                            </p>
                            <p>For financial reporting purposes, Intel expects to consolidate results of the joint
                                venture through net income and account for income attributable to the 49% ownership
                                interest in net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests. Intel expects
                                net income attributable to such non-controlling interest to be limited in the first two
                                years but to increase thereafter as the factory ramps to full capacity.</p>
                            <p>The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024.</p>
                            <p><strong>Intel’s Manufacturing Footprint in Ireland</strong></p>
                            <p>Intel celebrated the opening of Fab 34 in Ireland in September 2023, marking the first
                                use of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) in high-volume manufacturing in Europe. Fab
                                34 is designed to support high-volume production of Intel 3 and Intel 4 technologies. In
                                addition to Fab 34, Intel maintains a second manufacturing facility in Leixlip, Fab 24,
                                which has been a key location for production of Intel’s 14-nanometer silicon
                                microprocessors, while also preparing to support Intel Foundry customers. The
                                transaction with Apollo only pertains to Fab 34.</p>
