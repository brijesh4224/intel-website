                            Malaysia is known for its dual-tiered healthcare system. This system, led by the government and the private sector, offers a unique blend of universal coverage and diverse, choice-driven healthcare services. Despite this level of coverage, Malaysia still grapples with a pressing healthcare challenge—low rates of detection of cancer. Startling statistics reveal that over 63 percent of cancer diagnoses in Malaysia are made at advanced stages, severely limiting treatment options and significantly increasing healthcare costs. The most prevalent cancers—cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer—underscore the critical need for innovative solutions to revolutionize the diagnostic landscape. This multi-faceted issue necessitates a fundamental shift in healthcare delivery methodologies and patient awareness.

                        <h3 style="font-weight: 350; margin: 2.5rem 0 11px;">Pioneering Malaysia’s Digital Healthcare Transformation</h3>
                        <p>
                            One of the biggest challenges banks and building societies face is the lack of standardization across the industry. Different providers or divisions ask for inconsistent documentation and information from account holders and applicants. This fragmentation leads to client dissatisfaction, increased use of intermediaries, and increased cost of customer retention.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Malaysia grapples with a stark reality in cancer diagnostics—a screening coverage of 25 percent1 for cervical cancer and an early diagnosis rate of 10 percent2 for lung cancer. These figures stand in stark contrast to the 70 percent screening rate and 40 percent early diagnosis average in more developed countries. The reasons behind this disparity are deeply intertwined with the healthcare landscape and decision making in Malaysia, and reflect the challenges faced by digital transformation initiatives worldwide:
                        </p>
                        <h4 style="font-weight: 400; margin: 1.5rem 0 11px;">Negative Mindset and Trust Deficiency</h4>
                        <p>
                            A prevailing negative mindset towards screening, detection, and the combined cost implications serve as a barrier to early detection. Coupled with a lack of trust in the healthcare system, this makes cancer diagnosis challenging. 
                        </p>
                        <h4 style="font-weight: 400; margin: 1.5rem 0 11px;">Inconvenience In Early-Stage Proceduresy</h4>
                        <p>
                            Due to the growing number of cases and the subsequent constraints on medical infrastructure, seeking treatment during the early stages of cancer proves inconvenient. This can lead to delayed detection, limited treatment options, and negative treatment outcomes for those battling cancer. 
                        </p>
                        <h4 style="font-weight: 400; margin: 1.5rem 0 11px;">Outdated and Inefficient Workflows</h4>
                        <p>
                            The existing diagnostic workflows suffer from inefficiencies and outdated practices. Imaging reports, slides, and medical records are often stored offline or in physical formats. This hinders their accessibility and shareability among medical professionals. The result is often inaccurate or misdiagnosis which can reduce the probability of a positive treatment outcome.
                        </p>
                        <h4 style="font-weight: 400; margin: 1.5rem 0 11px;">High Cost of Diagnosis and Screening</h4>
                        <p>
                            Lastly, the financial burden associated with cancer diagnosis and screening further exacerbates the challenge, creating a vicious cycle of misdiagnosis and missed opportunities for the right treatment, especially targeted therapies. To be truly effective, the digital transformation of 3D diagnostic and early screening systems would need to address these challenges.

                            At the chip level, Intel SGX creates a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) that safeguards both the intellectual property of algorithms and the privacy of patients’ healthcare data. This combination of hardware and software provides a robust federated learning ecosystem for the MetaLite solution allowing it to aggregate de-identified results centrally without exposing any party’s confidential data to others. This level of confidential computing reinforces all the stakeholders’ commitment to maintaining the highest standards of security and confidentiality in healthcare diagnostics.

                        <h3 style="font-weight: 350; margin: 2.5rem 0 11px;">The Results: Efficiency and Cost Optimization In 3D Imaging Workflows</h3>
                        <p>
                            The impact of MetaLite on healthcare workflows is both quantifiable and groundbreaking. Through meticulous deployment, the solution has achieved a remarkable 20 percent increase in the efficiency of diagnostic workflows, a 50 percent reduction in diagnostic costs, streamlining processes and reducing the time from imaging to diagnosis.<sup>4</sup> This not only expedites patient care but also plays a pivotal role in addressing the challenges associated with late-stage cancer diagnoses.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Furthermore, the financial implications of MetaLite are nothing short of transformative. The solution has delivered significant cost savings in the domain of imaging and diagnoses, underscoring its economic viability for digital healthcare in Malaysia. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The impact of MetaLite on healthcare workflows extends beyond efficiency gains and cost reductions, making a significant contribution to Malaysia’s early screening programs for cervical cancer. By integrating seamlessly into these programs, MetaLite not only expedites diagnostic workflows, reducing the time from imaging to diagnosis and streamlining processes, but also contributes to the scalability of early screening initiatives. This strategic integration is poised to save considerable manpower and man-hours, ensuring a more widespread and efficient reach of these solutions. MetaLite’s role in Malaysia’s early screening programs represents a paradigm shift, leveraging technology to address the challenges associated with late-stage cancer diagnoses while optimizing resources for more extensive and impactful healthcare interventions

                        <h3 style="font-weight: 350; margin: 2.5rem 0 11px;">Ushering In a New Era In Digital Healthcare and Diagnostics</h3>
                        <p>
                            Since Malaysia lies at the heart of Southeast Asia, the success of this solution has widespread implications for the digital transformation of healthcare in the entire subregion. The strides made in improving diagnostic workflows, reducing costs, and seamlessly integrating into early screening programs for cervical cancer mark a significant leap forward in the landscape of healthcare technology.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            MetaLite’s success in Malaysia not only addresses the immediate challenges faced by the healthcare system but also sets the stage for a more interconnected and technology-driven approach to healthcare in Southeast Asia. With the approval from the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA), MetaLite is poised for a broader regional deployment, promising to revolutionize healthcare diagnostics across borders. The collaborative efforts of JelloX Biotech Inc. and Intel have not only elevated healthcare efficiency in Malaysia but have sown the seeds for a new era of digital healthcare in the entire Southeast Asian region.
