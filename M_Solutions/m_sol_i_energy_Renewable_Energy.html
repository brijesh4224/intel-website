                            Since the days of Thomas Edison, power has been available to almost anyone at the flick of a switch. For over a century that was made possible by fossil fuels. But the rising threat of climate change has spurred the development of alternative energy sources that are both endlessly renewable and nonpolluting. Now, companies, cities, countries, and entire regions are rushing to embrace renewable energy, the fastest-growing global energy source.
                        </p>

                            Over 100 cities around the world now get more than 70 percent of their electricity from renewable sources.1 The ambition isn’t limited to cities: over 150 companies are committed to work toward using only renewable power.2  Intel is high on that list: Intel® technologies are making it possible to convert and manage renewable sources and find new ways to integrate them into the modern energy grid. Using secure, connected IoT solutions that employ Intel® technology, electric utilities and cities are turning real-time data into clear visualizations.
                        </p>

                            The technology to capture and convert the sun’s inexhaustible energy into electricity seems to be in a constant state of innovation. Solar panels themselves are continually becoming more efficient. Whether it’s a rooftop “solar skin” that is barely visible or solar-powered pavement that generates clean energy and powers its own streetlights, breakthroughs in photovoltaics (PV) are announced on a regular basis.

                            Like a traditional grid, energy generation is the heart of a microgrid system. This can range from diesel generators and batteries, the most common sources at the moment, to power generated by renewable resources such as solar panels, wind farms, fuel cells, or other sources of renewable energy.
                        </p>
                        <p class="m_para2">
                            The point of common coupling (PCC) is where a microgrid connects to the main grid. In connected mode, the two systems operate in parallel, with the PCC maintaining equal voltage levels in both. The PCC can also allow the microgrid to import and export electricity from the parent grid in response to appropriate price signals, utilizing energy storage mechanisms such as batteries.
                        </p>
                        <p class="m_para2">
                            If there is a problem with the main grid, a switch can disconnect the grids either manually or automatically. In island mode, the microgrid can still provide enough power to serve critical customer loads, even if the main grid is offline. The machine learning capability of AI software helps to continuously optimize the process.
                        </p>
                        <p class="m_para2">
                            IoT products can make the grid smarter, safer, more secure, and more reliable, all while lowering costs for customers. Utilities that need to keep voltage and current at steady levels use Intel® architecture-based platforms to identify performance issues. Smart meters and sensors embedded in power lines can help prevent power outages, while other monitoring and predictive maintenance solutions for transformers and pumps reduce risk and cost.

                                Where are microgrids most useful? It depends on the situation and scale. A campus microgrid serves a single user such as a university, hospital, prison, or industrial facility. Community and district microgrids serve multiple customers. Both are fully integrated into the local energy grid. At the other end of the scale, a nanogrid can supply a single building. “Off-grid” systems are entirely disconnected from local utility networks, useful at remote sites, islands, or other places where economic or technical issues make a PCC impossible.
