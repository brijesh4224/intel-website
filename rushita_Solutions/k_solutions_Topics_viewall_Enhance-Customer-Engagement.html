                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5">A New Era of Enriched Customer Engagement</h3>
                        <p>Picture this: A new customer arrives at your company’s website. They’re greeted by an AI
                            chatbot that points them in the right direction, streamlining their experience and
                            shortening their path to purchase. From there, more AI technologies work in the background
                            to provide personalized suggestions based on your customer’s browsing patterns.</p>
                        <p>Once they’ve completed their order, AI-enabled process automation allows them to pick it up
                            at a store in a few hours. At the store, an AI-powered kiosk helps the customer easily
                            navigate to the right counter. And when the customer decides to pick up some additional
                            items, computer vision‒enabled checkout helps make the purchase experience fast and
                            painless.</p>
                        <p>Just a few years ago, such an experience may have sounded prohibitively expensive or too
                            complex to implement. But today, using AI in innovative ways to enhance the customer
                            experience is within reach for businesses of all sizes. Organizations across industries are
                            using technologies like generative AI, natural language processing, computer vision, and
                            recommendation engines to revolutionize the customer experience, enhance engagement, and
                            build revenue.</p>
                        <p>Of course, realizing these powerful business outcomes from your AI investments requires you
                            to have the right approach, tools, and technologies at your disposal. To help equip your
                            initiative for success, let’s walk through some key considerations for using AI to enhance
                            the customer experience and increase engagement.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5">Identify the Right Use Case for Your Business</h3>
                        <p>Every business is unique—and you know your operations and customers better than anyone. As
                            you seek to enrich the customer experience through AI, it’s critical to strategically apply
                            AI to the parts of your business where it can deliver the most value and have the most
                            powerful impact on your customer experience. You’ll also want to be mindful of existing
                            investments in areas such as your software stack, AI-capable hardware, and other AI tools
                            already in play.</p>

                        <p>Gone are the days when organizations seeking to enhance engagement through AI needed to spend
                            a lot of time and energy obtaining an AI model to fit their desired use case.</p>
                        <p>In fact, today’s businesses can obtain the AI capabilities they need in several ways,
                            including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fine-tuning a preexisting or foundational model: Organizations can take advantage of an
                                ever-growing number of purpose-built, open source models such as Llama 2, GPT-J, or
                                Dolly that fulfill a wide range of business applications. These models can be customized
                                to fit the specific requirements of your industry and desired use case. This process is
                                typically called fine-tuning.</li>
                            <li>Purchasing AI-enabled software with built-in algorithms:<strong> </strong>Many common
                                use cases are also supported by software offerings that help you rapidly deploy AI

                            <li>Training a model from the ground up: Some organizations may find their situation so

                                scratch. Here, tools such as the <a href="#"
