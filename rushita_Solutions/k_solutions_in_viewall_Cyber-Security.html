                                Defending government cybersecurity requires a proactive, end-to-end approach rooted in hardware. Establishing a trusted infrastructure foundation built on a zero trust architecture can enable you to protect every digital point, from edge to network to cloud, today and into the future. Intel works with a broad ecosystem of partners to address the data security and privacy needs of government agencies. Apply layers of defense where and when you need them by employing Intel® products and technologies with integrated hardware-enabled security features.</h4>
                        </div>
                        <p>Threats to government cybersecurity are rising exponentially, as they are for all organizations worldwide. Data breaches alone now cost USD 5.2 trillion globally<sup>1</sup> and have exposed about 22 billion data records.<sup>2</sup></p>
                        <p>Contributing to the growth in breadth and complexity of the threat landscape are three main factors: the increasing sophistication of attacks; fragmentation of security solutions that leave gaps, making data vulnerable; and the expanding number of available attack surfaces.</p>
                        <p>In government and public sector environments where every operation revolves around data, securing communications end to end is a fundamental requirement. The need for all aspects of security to work together—from operating systems (OSs) and software to firmware and hardware—has never been greater. Cyber attackers are increasingly targeting firmware vulnerabilities, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).<sup>3</sup> Software protections, including OS security and data encryption, are no longer enough.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4" id="key1">Escalating Cybersecurity Risks</h3>
                        <p>Cybercriminals, both domestic and foreign, often target public sector infrastructure and systems. The range of incidents includes malware, phishing, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, unauthorized access, supply chain attacks, and control system attacks. Recent data reports highlight the scale of the cybersecurity challenge:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In FY 2021, US federal civilian agencies reported over 32,000 security incidents to the Department of Homeland Security, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.<sup>4</sup></li>
                            <li>Ransomware attacks doubled in the second half of 2022, targeting organizations across industries.<sup>5</sup> A 2022 Comparitech report found that ransomware attacks against US government agencies from 2018 to October 2022 potentially impacted nearly 230 million people—more than half of the US population— with an estimated downtime cost of over USD 70 billion, which is more than the national GDP of half the countries on the planet.<sup>6</sup></li>
                            <li>Cryptojacking typically consumes up to 50 percent of the endpoint compute resources of infected systems, going months or more without detection.<sup>7</sup></li>
                            <li>By the end of 2019, firmware vulnerabilities had increased by five times over the previous three years, and the number continues to grow today.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Firmware incursions below the OS are one of the hardest attacks to detect, are the least likely to be patched, and have the biggest potential impact, as most antivirus programs focus on the OS and above. Such attacks can be undetectable by traditional programs and practices.</li>
                            <li>Counterfeiting, tampering, theft, and insertion of hardware and software are increasing. Sonatype’s 8th Annual State of the Software Supply Chain report found that supply chain attacks increased an average of 742 percent per year between 2019 and 2022.<sup>9</sup></li>
                            <li>Cisco predicts DDoS attacks will reach 15.4 million by 2023, more than double the amount seen in 2018.<sup>10</sup> Additionally, 2022 threat reports from both NETSCOUT and Cloudflare reported increases in DDoS attacks across network and application layers.<sup>11</sup><sup>12</sup></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Security experts have long said that complexity is the worst enemy of security. The current landscape is rife with complexity, and the proliferation of spot security solutions and lack of a cohesive risk management approach is only helping to compound the problems.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Securing the Technology Stack</h3>
                        <p>A secure government technology infrastructure helps support the delivery of essential services. These span local public safety and national security to protect citizens, disease control and prevention to ensure health and well-being, and transportation to keep commerce moving. A strong, comprehensive cybersecurity strategy helps protect citizens’ personal data and government data simultaneously and enables users to conduct operations with more confidence.</p>
                        <p>Our experts at Intel believe the best strategy to cybersecurity is a proactive, end-to-end, zero trust approach that requires integration across people, process, and technology to address six key areas:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Threat and risk management</li>
                            <li>Data and application security</li>
                            <li>Identity access management</li>
                            <li>Network security</li>
                            <li>Host and system security</li>
                            <li>Supply chain security</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>It’s critical to protect endpoints from security threats. Intel supports edge security in several ways.</p>
                        <h4 class="fw-lighter">Internet of Things (IoT) Security</h4>
                        <p>IoT security must be capable of covering hundreds or thousands of connected devices and the immense volumes of data they generate.</p>
                        <p>For context, according to a 2023 Statista report, there are an estimated 19.8 billion connected IoT devices in use worldwide, with the number forecasted to grow to 30.9 billion by 2025.<sup>13</sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>Additionally, by 2025, IDC predicts that the data volume from the global datasphere—all data created from endpoint to edge to data center—will reach 175 zettabytes.<sup>14</sup></p>
                        <p>Intel advocates integrating security into IoT solutions, starting with the compute device itself. Advanced hardware and software can help prevent harmful applications from being activated on a device or from taking down a network.</p>
