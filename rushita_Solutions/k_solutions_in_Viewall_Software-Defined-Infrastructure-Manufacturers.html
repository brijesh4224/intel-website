                                technology(IT) and OT workloads</a>&nbsp;that’s based on flexible, general-purpose
                            compute. This new unified infrastructure exists as a centralized pool of resources, enabled
                            by virtualization technologies, and can be managed from a centralized interface. Crucially,
                            the capabilities of numerous different appliances can be consolidated on a single
                            plant-floor server or industrial PC to help reduce management overhead, lower the equipment
                            footprint, and simplify operations.</p>
