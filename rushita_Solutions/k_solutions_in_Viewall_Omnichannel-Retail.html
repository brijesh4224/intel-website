                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Omnichannel retail is a strategy in which retailers engage
                            customers through multiple digital and physical touchpoints. As customers move across these
                            channels, applications and data move with them. This creates a consistent, on-brand
                            experience from start to finish. With this understanding, large brands are now using an
                            omnichannel <a href="#">store as media</a>&nbsp;strategy, along with other experiences,
                            within a brick-and-mortar location to further their reach, visibility, and impact with their
                            consumer audiences.</p>

                                        where there is not a physical world or digital world in retail, but rather a

                    <p class="mt-5">When today’s customers shop, they use everything from traditional brick-and-mortar
                        stores to websites to social media to mobile apps. Customers expect connected journeys, and 76
                        percent of customers expect consistent interactions across
                        departments<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp;Customers also expect the omnichannel retail process to address
                        product delivery options, including curbside pickups, lockers, buying online and picking up in
                        store (BOPIS), and all other touchpoints in their relationship with a retailer.</p>
                    <p>With an integrated omnichannel strategy, retailers can provide hyperconvenient, personalized
                        shopping experiences at every point in the customer journey—whether that customer is shopping
                        online, via their mobile device, or in a store. The idea behind omnichannel retail is to create
                        frictionless and personalized customer experiences at the exact moment of relevance.</p>
                    <p>Creating a better experience for customers across all channels, in turn, fosters greater
                        satisfaction and loyalty, as well as additional benefits for the businesses themselves. By
                        analyzing the customer journey, retailers can improve their strategies around marketing,
                        merchandising, loyalty programs, and inventory management, and they can dedicate resources where
                        they will matter most to meet their customers’ fast-changing expectations.</p>

                    <p>A unified omnichannel retail strategy provides a consistent brand experience and accurate
                        information at every touchpoint. Where possible, experiences are integrated with the customer’s
                        activities via other channels.</p>
                    <div class="k_img1 my-5">
                        <img src="../img/rushita_img/channel1.png" alt="" width="100%">
                    </div>
                    <p>For example, a customer might see an online promotion, log in to a brand’s app to view their
                        loyalty rewards status, place an order, then go to retrieve their purchase from a secure locker.
                        The customer’s information would be retained throughout the process for a seamless shopping
                        experience across all channels.</p>
                    <p>Alternately, a customer could do an online search and save items to a future purchase wish list.
                        At a later date, that customer could go into the store or online purchase portal, retrieve their
                        wish list, and buy those items using loyalty rewards points toward their purchase. Once
                        purchased, the stock level in the supporting inventory management system and the customer’s
                        purchase history record would be updated. With this data available in near-real-time, the
                        retailer would have an accurate picture of available inventory as well as valuable insights into
                        customer behavior. The customer experience is seamlessly integrated and branded at all
                        touchpoints for consistency. And the physical store becomes integrated with a digital experience
                        from both the customer and data analytics perspective.</p>
                    <p>A well-executed omnichannel strategy will eliminate confusing experiences that disappoint
                        customers. For example, a customer could check the availability of a popular item on the phone,
                        see it is available at the nearest store, and have confidence it will be in stock when they
                        arrive for pickup.</p>

                    <p>A successful omnichannel strategy is an ongoing journey that is regularly curated to maximize
                        connections between various data points from customer-facing technologies, back-of-house
                        operational systems, and supporting technology infrastructure to deliver a seamless customer
                        experience. When data can be shared across a unified ecosystem, customers and retailers benefit.
                    </p>
                    <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Businesses can offer personalized sales recommendations, confirm
                        customer account information from any source where the customer has previously shared it, and
                        further enhance the customer experience at the moment of the transaction, whether it takes place
                        online, at a <a href="../d_partner/d_kiosk.htm">kiosk</a>,&nbsp;or on a personal device.</p>

                        processing it locally at the edge, there is less data at risk in a single moment of transaction.

                    <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">The Future of Omnichannel in Retail</h3>
                    <p>Optimizing customer engagement and experiences across channels is an ongoing effort. Customers
                        expect convenience, which means digital experiences need to have smooth interchanges and
                        integrate well with in-store operations.</p>
                    <p>Given the recent changes in buyer behavior, customers may expect that convenience means they
                        don’t have to go to a store. If customers do need to go to a store, they will want a meaningful
                        reason, such as an experience they cannot get online or that starts online and completes in the
                        physical location. Consequently, merchants will need to design unique, thoughtful buying
                        experiences that personalize to their customers’ wants and needs.</p>
                    <p>For example, imagine a customer using a mobile device to search for or purchase a product. The
                        data from that buying journey or purchase gets transmitted to the business’s systems that look
                        for trends, patterns, behaviors, and product updates. The brand’s sales representative can then
                        access and use the information derived from that data in near-real time, through point of sale
                        (POS) systems or other enabled devices, to provide that customer with personalized upsells or
                        promotions. Even more, retailers can use the data analytics to see buying trends, track product
                        performance, and update sales strategies and marketing campaigns.</p>
                    <p class="my-0">Opportunities for frictionless customer experiences are becoming commonplace:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A customer can buy a product online or from a mobile device and easily pick it up in the
                            store, curbside, or from a locker.</li>
                        <li>An item placed in an online shopping cart will appear in the customer’s mobile app and in
                            in-store platforms, such as POS or sales assist systems.</li>
                        <li>A customer can use a mobile app or self-service kiosk to find an item in the store. If it’s
                            not available at that location, the customer has the ability to easily find and order it
                            from another store. By sharing insights across the cloud from multiple stores, the second
                            store can not only respond locally to larger system-wide trends but also have the item
                            pulled from inventory and ready for pickup when the customer arrives.</li>
                        <li class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">When a customer is returning an item, the <a
                                href="../rushita_Solutions/k_solutions_in_Viewall_ Point-of-Sale.html">POS
                                system</a>&nbsp;will accept a proof of purchase from any channel using the customer’s
                            membership details or credit card.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Omnichannel retail requires a cohesive, 360-degree experience in store, curbside, and online.
                        Social commerce will become a more significant strategy using, for example, livestream videos
                        that promote in-store-only deals.</p>
                    <p>Curated products that forecast as popular based on customer buying data will become a focal point
                        in future marketing campaigns that drive demand. Suggestive selling will be customized based on
                        integrated insights from consumer information.</p>

                    <p>Automation will support human labor so routine tasks can be delegated in the interest of ensuring human workers can focus on customer relationships and responsibilities that require higher-order thinking.</p>
                    <p>Omnichannel retail will consider back-of-house operations for warehouse automation, inventory control, and better fulfillment procedures. Last-mile delivery is already a focal point for visionary retailers. In time, shorter delivery windows will become a standard customer expectation.</p>

                                    computing and high-speed networking. Instruments are assembled to create
                                    workflows that are managed by automated control systems and information
                                    management systems. High-performance workstations and on-premise or cloud-based
