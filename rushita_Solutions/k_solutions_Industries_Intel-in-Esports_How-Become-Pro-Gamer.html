                        <p class="fw-light my-5" id="key1">Since its humble beginnings in 2007, the Intel® Extreme Masters (IEM)
                            tournament has grown from the corner of a German tech expo to a global event hosted in
                            sold-out stadiums with millions<sup>1</sup> of fans tuning in. Esports on a whole has
                            followed a similar trajectory. Today’s professional gamers compete around the world for
                            major prizes and renown at Esports events such as the International DOTA 2 Championship and
                            the&nbsp;Intel® Extreme Masters Grand Finals. Blizzard*, meanwhile, built a dedicated arena
                            in Los Angeles for hosting and streaming Overwatch League events. Some universities offer
                            Esports scholarships.

                        </p>
                        <p>Anyone who loves games has probably wondered how to become a pro gamer. Whether you’re
                            looking to get into solo or team competition, there is a blueprint to launching a gaming
                            career.</p>
                        <h3 class="fw-light mt-5 pt-3" id="key2">10 Steps to Becoming a Pro Gamer</h3>
                        <p><strong>Find Your Motivation</strong></p>
                        <p>As with anything in life, it’s important to play Esports for the right reasons. The love of
                            competition, the satisfaction of growing as a player, and the sense of contributing to a
                            team and community are all valid reasons to play.</p>
                        <p>In the long run, positive motivations are what keeps players engaged. Players who are
                            motivated by cash, fame, and quick success, on the other hand, will likely burn out before
                            ever turning pro. Loving the game will make a world of difference during daily practice as
                            you gradually acquire the skills to turn pro.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pick Your Game</strong></p>
                        <p>The next step is to find your game. There are two schools of thought here: either pick a game
                            that’s up-and-coming or go with a well-established game.</p>
                        <p>The value of picking a game that’s established as an Esport is that the infrastructure and
                            resources are already in place to support pro gaming. Longstanding Esports titles like
                            <em>League of Legends</em>, <em>Dota 2</em>, and <em>CounterStrike: Global Offensive
                            </em>(<em>CS:GO</em>) have large, dedicated player bases and, by extension, sponsored
                            tournaments with lucrative prizes. The downside is that they are tougher scenes for
                            newcomers to break into.</p>
                        <p>When a game is up and coming, players have an opportunity to help excavate the game and
                            advance the meta, which tends to be more volatile and accommodating of different play styles
                            at the outset. Founding players of games like <em>Rocket League<sup>2</sup></em> and
                            <em>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds,<sup>3</sup></em>&nbsp;for instance, have found themselves
                            propelled to the center of the Esports stage. That said, there's also a risk that a game's
                            competitive scene will fail to thrive, at which point you may have to pick a new game.</p>
                        <p>Our advice is to try a few out and stick with the one you truly love. You’re going to be
                            playing it a lot.</p>
                        <p><strong>Join the Community</strong></p>
                        <p>As much as pro gaming is about individual talent, it’s also about the culture surrounding the
                            game. Before investing too much time learning the nuts and bolts of a specific game, spend
                            some time lurking on forums and other places where players congregate. The experience will
                            provide a better indication of the path ahead, and you’ll be able to judge if the pro player
                            journey aligns with your personal goals and motivations.</p>
                        <p>Immersing yourself in a game’s scene is essential to advancing your career, so make sure you
                            enjoy the company of other players. For one thing, the finer points of a game’s meta are
                            sussed out on message boards, forums, and YouTube channels. Players need to interact with
                            each other in order to keep track of the evolving meta and also to iterate on it —
                            contributing back to the scene they belong to.</p>

                        <p><strong>Gear Up</strong></p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Make sure you're playing on the right gear, starting with a good gaming mouse, and mechanical
                            keyboard. There are a lot of options when it comes to peripherals — varying in size, form
                            factor, and sensitivity — but it's best to choose the one that works for you. To get some
                            ideas, <a href="../rushita_Solutions/k_solutions_Industries_Intel-in-Esports_Gaming-Peripherals-According-Pros.html">hear what Esports
                                pros had to say about the gaming peripherals they use</a>.</p>
                        <p>Whichever peripherals you choose, it’s good practice to use the same mouse and the same
                            keyboard every scrim, every game. Just look at pros today. The equipment they use at the
                            gaming house is the same equipment they will use to compete with on-stage. Developing
                            familiarity with your peripherals makes it easier to transition to a tournament environment,
                            where nerves and pressure come into play.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Consistency is also a factor when it comes to hardware. Pro gaming event organizers are
                            conscientious of selecting system components that won’t hamper gameplay with lag or erratic
                            frame rates. The performance of your <a

                        </div>
                        <p>With in-game matchmaking and premium third-party matchmaking services like ESEA, it’s easy to
                            find people to play against. But if you want to win, you’ll need to practice.</p>
                        <p>First, master the game’s mechanics. Concentrate on learning game-specific skills until they
                            become ingrained in your muscle memory. Whether that’s last-hitting in a MOBA, aiming with
                            accuracy in an FPS, or maximizing actions-per-minute in an RTS, these skills never lose
                            their importance. Pro players practice mechanics tirelessly to stay sharp and make minute
                            improvements, but players who are just starting out should improve dramatically with
                            practice.</p>
                        <p>While you’re honing your skills, start researching the game’s overarching strategy. A good
                            Esport has many layers of strategy, ranging from situational strategy — such as the role of
                            a jungler lurking between lanes — to top-tier meta. Understanding your role in a given
                            situation is a good place to start, as the meta used by the pros — like the nearly
                            unstoppable GOATS strategy that dominated Season 1 of Overwatch League — can be too
                            complicated for beginners to coordinate.</p>
                        <p>Still, there’s a lot to be gained from watching top players. Both videos and live-streams are
                            great resources for learning good in-game habits and provide a reference point for how you
                            should be playing the game.</p>
                        <p>Later on, as you’re getting better, reviewing replays of your own matches will allow you to
                            break down your play style and learn from your mistakes. All the best players do it.</p>
                        <p><b>Climb the Ladder</b></p>
                        <p>If you want to become a pro, it takes a strong desire to win at every phase of competition.
                            This means topping the scoreboard in pick-up groups, climbing the ladder in matchmaking, and
                            being the last team standing in tournaments.</p>

                        <p>Familiarize yourself with the hierarchy of the levels of competition, as each Esport has its
                            own system in place for bringing new players into the fold. In&nbsp;<i>CS:GO</i>, for
                            example, a player typically progresses from public games to matchmaking and then on to
                            leagues and tournaments. There will be different trajectories for different Esports.</p>
                        <p>Climbing the ladder allows young players to make a name for themselves. This can help them
                            find a spot on an amateur team (or a home in a sub-community for solo games), which in turn
                            can be a stepping stone to a pro gaming organization.</p>
                        <p><b>Find a Team</b></p>
                        <div class="my-5">
                            <img src="../img/rushita_img/probg2.jpg" alt="" width="100%">
                        </div>
                        <p>Once you build a reputation as a serious competitor, find a team. Playing alongside others —
                            especially those who are better than you, or who have different skill sets — is one of the
                            most valuable experiences a player can have.</p>
                        <p>If you’re really good, a team will probably find you. If not, you can try out for teams. The
                            website Teamfind, for instance, has forums and tools for teams and players to communicate.
                            Discord servers, subreddits, and Steam groups also serve as prime recruitment grounds for
                            amateur teams.</p>
                        <p>Learning to play well with others is required for team-based games
                            like&nbsp;<i>CS:GO</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Dota 2</i>. So find a role that you like and a group
                            of players that you gel with. But even for solo games
                            like&nbsp;<i>Hearthstone</i>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<i>StarCraft 2</i>, there’s value in connecting
                            with a like-minded sub-community.</p>
                        <p><b>Compete and Get Noticed</b><br>
                        </p>
                        <div class="my-5">

                        <p>Getting good at the game is only half the battle. The other half is making connections that
                            will help you ascend the competitive ladder. Once you’ve found your footing in more
                            competitive lobbies, start networking. Leverage your position as a quality opponent to
                            connect with better players.</p>
                        <p>Building relationships with better players can lead to bigger things, such as invites to
                            private Discord channels, where you’ll have the chance to play in exclusive scrims and rub
                            shoulders with elite players. Environments like these are where players tend to get noticed
                            by pro organizations.</p>
                        <p><strong>Stay Balanced</strong></p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">While the grind mentality looms large in Esports, pros must learn how to balance their
                            practice regimen and off-screen activities. <a

                        <p>Becoming a pro gamer takes years of hard work and practice, but there’s more to it than
