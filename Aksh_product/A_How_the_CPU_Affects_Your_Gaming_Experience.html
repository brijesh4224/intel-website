                                        developer’s intentions. This could translate into fuller, more realistic
                                        experiences and more meticulous levels of detail. But you can’t just flip a
                                        switch and “turn on” settings like draw distance, cloth simulation, and
                                        destruction physics. Each of them scale depending on the quality of your

                                    <p class="V_pv">In a real-time strategy game like <i>Total War: THREE KINGDOMS</i>,
                                        epic battles mean armies of epic proportions. The truth, however, is that
                                        accounting for every individual troop on the field can be incredibly taxing for
                                        your computer.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="V_pv "><i>Total War</i> battles are unique because of their scale,”
                                        <i>THREE KINGDOMS’ </i>Technical Director Chalie Dell said. “We model thousands
                                        of soldiers with a great level of detail applied to each in terms of animations,
                                        interactions, pathfinding decisions and so on.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">In addition, the CPU is often juggling many tasks at the same time
                                        depending on what’s being displayed onscreen. “Let’s take a scene where two huge
                                        frontlines of thousands of troops are clashing, and you have the camera zoomed
                                        in fairly close,” Dell said. “In this situation, the CPU’s time will mostly be
                                        split between entity agent-based combat, collision mechanics, and building the
                                        matrix stacks in order to draw all the entities.” In other words, the CPU has to
                                        manage the presence and interactions of thousands of NPCs at the same time.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">These are situations best mediated by parallelization, a process
                                        that involves delegating processing tasks to different cores in a multi-core
                                        CPU. Thus, <i>Total War</i> ’ performance scales according to the number of
                                        cores available. “The more cores the engine has at its disposal, the more
                                        soldiers we can display in any fixed period of time,” Dell said. “This is best
                                        illustrated in <i>Total War: THREE KINGDOMS</i>’ new Dynasty Mode, where you can
                                        crank the unit count up by 500%. The more cores your CPU has, the better
                                        framerate you get.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">Having multiple cores isn’t the only important thing to consider,
                                        however. “Certain aspects of our simulation are less easily parallelized, such
                                        as the AI processing,” Dell explained. “When a large amount of instructions like
                                        this is executed on a single core, a higher clock speed is desirable in order to
                                        keep things running smoothly.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">The CPU has multiple roles in powering games. “Straight-line
                                        performance and multiple cores across which to spread the workload are both
                                        desirable CPU qualities for <i>Total War</i> players,” Dell concluded.

                                        <p class="V_pv">From the bustling streets of Mumbai to a colorful racetrack in
                                            Miami, <i>HITMAN 2</i>’s detailed environments experience palpable benefits
                                            when using a CPU with more cores. “<i>HITMAN 2</i> on PC is able to scale up
                                            its quality by using the additional power provided by more cores,”<i>HITMAN
                                                2</i>’s Technical Director Maurizio De Pascale said.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv"><i>HITMAN 2 </i>even buckets its in-game settings into three
                                            different levels of “CPU simulation”: “base” is the default for machines
                                            with four cores, “better” is the default for machines with six cores, and
                                            “best” is the default for any machine with over eight cores.</p>

                                        <p class="V_pv">So how does CPU affect performance when you choose to game with
                                            the “best” settings? “This will affect things like audio, crowds, cloth
                                            simulation, NPC animation, and destruction, just to name the major ones,” De
                                            Pascale said. “Crowds will be denser yet at the same time provide more
                                            visual variety with bespoke animations and behaviors. For instance, in the
                                            Miami level, you'll see many of them waving cloth-simulated flags.”</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Though <i>HITMAN 2</i>’s largest level houses as many as 300
                                            NPCs, only a small fraction of the NPCs actually receive a full update every
                                            frame. In other words, you might observe a lower frame rate in the
                                            animations of some NPCs than those of others depending on how many are
                                            onscreen at a time. “This can result in NPCs in the distance being updated
                                            at lower frequency and manifests with visible glitches in their animations,”
                                            De Pascale said. Having more cores increases the amount of NPCs that receive
                                            a full update per frame, with the “base” level updating 40, the “better”
                                            level updating 80, and the “best” level updating 120 NPCs.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Crowd density isn’t the only important element affected by the
                                            power of the player’s CPU. When using the “best” settings, destructible
                                            objects are capable of producing more particles and shards. Even audio
                                            effects benefit directly from having access to more cores. “On CPUs with
                                            higher core counts, we use a more costly algorithm for the convolution
                                            reverb, which results in an audio experience that is less gamey and more
                                            realistic and immersive,” De Pascale described. For example, when using the
                                            “best” settings, the sound of a gunshot from the room next door will possess
                                            the reverb of the room in which Agent 47 is currently standing, which is how
                                            you would hear the gunshot in person. When using lower settings, however,
                                            the sound of the gunshot might obtain the reverb from the room in which it
                                            originated, resulting in a less realistic experience.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Realism and immersion are at the heart of what makes <i>HITMAN 2
                                            </i>such an impressive experience when played with a high-end CPU. Though De
                                            Pascale said that players using the “base” and “best” settings will
                                            encounter identical gameplay, he noted that playing with better settings
                                            heightens the overall quality of the experience. “In a sense, this
                                            multi-core powered experience on your gaming PC is closer to what our
                                            designers had originally intended for the game,” De Pascale said.</p>
