                        <p>International shipping is involved in 90% of world trade.[1] Just take a look at Shipmap.org
                            to see the thousands of ships carrying millions of containers to get a sense of how truly
                            enormous global shipping is on a daily basis. With significant opportunities to improve
                            safety and efficiency in this huge market, a Rolls-Royce team based in Finland and Norway
                            has been working to bring autonomy to shipping vessels using Intel® technologies.</p>
                        <p>Autonomous shipping presents many challenges. Disparate visual and positional sensor data
                            must be detected, processed, and analyzed at the edge, all in real-time. With shipping, the
                            data from these sensors are at greater scale than in other autonomous vehicle applications.
                            For example, LIDAR sensors in shipping vessels must detect objects from several kilometers
                            away, often in difficult weather conditions. Shipping vessels also need cameras with
                            far-higher pixel count to see objects in, on, and over the water at distances of several
                            kilometers, which means that large digital images must be processed for great detail. In
                            addition, shipping vessels need to be outfitted with thermal, radar, and other sensors, all
                            of which need to be fused together in order to read the environment. These sensors can
                            produce enormous amounts of data – as much as 1TB of data per day, per vessel, about the
                            same digital footprint as 250 high-definition feature-length movies.</p>

                    <h4>Intel on Board</h4>
                    <div class=" fs-5">
                        <p>To deal with this incredible amount of data, <a href="#" class="b_special_a1">Rolls-Royce is
                                incorporating Intel technology into their Ship Intelligence* platforms</a>. Intel® Xeon®
                            Scalable processors will be used on ships themselves and in data centers on land. Due to the
                            need for real-time results, several server-class computers onboard ships will run machine
                            learning and inference workloads locally.</p>
                        <p>Real-time inference on large images at scale is difficult. Deep neural networks must be
                            employed to detect objects from far away and video encoding and decoding must occur. With
                            the versatility for visual cloud, AI, analytics, and countless other applications, Intel
                            Xeon Scalable processors give Rolls-Royce the flexibility and processing power needed for
                            this type of extreme computing.</p>
                        <p>Shipping vessels are massive, allowing for the space and power to house modest on-board data
                            centers. All of the data generated is stored on a “black box” (similar to an airplane’s
                            flight data recorder), in case of a potential accident and for future training and analysis.
                            Rolls-Royce currently uses Intel® 3D NAND SSDs for ship data storage and is evaluating
                            Intel® Optane™ SSDs for future use.&nbsp;Additionally, Rolls-Royce is considering Intel®
                            FPGAs to accelerate algorithm training using this data.</p>
