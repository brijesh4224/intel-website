                            <li>U.S. Department of Commerce has proposed up to $8.5 billion in direct funding through the CHIPS and Science Act to advance Intel’s commercial semiconductor projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon.</li>
                            <li>Intel also expects to benefit from a U.S. Treasury Department Investment Tax Credit (ITC) of up to 25% on more than $100 billion in qualified investments and eligibility for federal loans up to $11 billion.</li>
                            <li>Proposed funding supports Intel’s previously announced plans to invest more than $100 billion in the U.S. over five years to expand U.S. chipmaking capacity and capabilities critical to economic and national security and acceleration of emerging technologies, such as AI.</li>
                            <li>Intel’s investments are expected to create more than 10,000 company jobs and nearly 20,000 construction jobs, and to support more than 50,000 indirect jobs with suppliers and supporting industries.</li>

                        <p>SANTA CLARA, Calif., and WASHINGTON, March 20, 2024 – The Biden-Harris Administration announced today that Intel and the U.S. Department of Commerce have signed a non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms (PMT) for up to $8.5 billion in direct funding to Intel for commercial semiconductor projects under the CHIPS and Science Act.</p>
                        <p>CHIPS Act funding aims to increase U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and research and development capabilities, especially in leading-edge semiconductors. Intel is the only American company that both designs and manufactures leading-edge logic chips. The proposed funding would help advance Intel’s critical semiconductor manufacturing and research and development projects at its sites in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon, where the company develops and produces many of the world’s most advanced chips and semiconductor packaging technologies.</p>
                        <p>“Today is a defining moment for the U.S. and Intel as we work to power the next great chapter of American semiconductor innovation,” said Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger. “AI is supercharging the digital revolution and everything digital needs semiconductors. CHIPS Act support will help to ensure that Intel and the U.S. stay at the forefront of the AI era as we build a resilient and sustainable semiconductor supply chain to power our nation’s future.”</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1"><strong>Press Kit:</strong> <a href="#">U.S. CHIPS Act Funding for Intel</a></p>
                        <p>Together, the CHIPS Act proposed funding and Intel’s previously announced plans to invest more than $100 billion in the U.S. over five years constitute one of the largest public-private investments ever made in the U.S. semiconductor industry. The historic investment will create thousands of new company positions and construction jobs, foster U.S.-based R&amp;D, strengthen U.S. supply chains, and help ensure American leadership in leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing and technology capabilities.</p>
                        <p>Today’s announcement demonstrates the U.S. government’s confidence in Intel’s leadership and commitment to expanding U.S. chipmaking capacity and capabilities. It is an investment in America’s technology future, bringing innovation, opportunity and jobs to America.</p>
                        <p>“There is no one who cares more about revitalizing American manufacturing than President Biden, and today’s announcement is a massive step towards ensuring America’s leadership in manufacturing for the 21st century. With this agreement, we are helping to incentivize over $100 billion in investments from Intel – marking one of the largest investments ever in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, which will create over 30,000 good-paying jobs and ignite the next generation of innovation,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “This announcement is the culmination of years of work by President Biden and bipartisan efforts in Congress to ensure that the leading-edge chips we need to secure our economic and national security are made in the U.S.”</p>

                            <p>Under the PMT, Intel would also have the option to draw upon federal loans of up to $11 billion. Intel also plans to claim the U.S. Treasury Department’s Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which is expected to be up to 25% of qualified investments of more than $100 billion over five years. The PMT provides that the direct funding award and federal loans are subject to due diligence and negotiation of a long-form term sheet and award documents, and are conditional on the achievement of certain milestones and remain subject to availability of funds.</p>
                            <p><strong>Technology Leadership</strong></p>

                            <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Intel was founded in the U.S. and has been innovating, investing and supporting global semiconductor manufacturing and R&amp;D for more than 50 years. Intel currently employs nearly 55,000 people in the U.S., indirectly supports over 720,000 American jobs and <a href="#">contributes more than $102 billion annually to U.S. GDP</a>.&nbsp;With support from the CHIPS Act funding, Intel’s planned U.S. investments are expected to create more than 10,000 new permanent jobs at Intel and nearly 20,000 construction jobs, and they will indirectly support more than 50,000 jobs with suppliers and supporting industries.</p>
                            <p><strong>Semiconductor Talent and Sustainable Manufacturing</strong></p>
                            <p>To meet the growing demand for future semiconductor talent, Intel is driving innovative partnerships with government and academia to create a robust and diverse ecosystem of skilled semiconductor talent critical to the success of the entire semiconductor industry and the U.S. economy. Intel announced a $100 million investment in 2022 to expand semiconductor education, research and workforce training opportunities across the nation. This investment includes a $50 million partnership with the National Science Foundation and $50 million&nbsp;to fund the&nbsp;Semiconductor Education and Research Program (SERP) for Ohio&nbsp;– a collaborative, multi-institution program designed to directly support Intel’s investments in the Silicon Heartland.</p>
                            <p>Intel recognizes that resilient supply chains must also be sustainable, and the company is committed to becoming the industry’s most sustainable semiconductor foundry. Intel currently uses 100% renewable electricity in fabs and other operations in the U.S. and recently redoubled its commitment to achieve 100% renewable electricity worldwide by 2030. In addition, Intel has aggressive goals of achieving net-positive water and zero waste to landfills by 2030, net-zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040 and net-zero upstream Scope 3 emissions by 2050. On March 19 and 20, Intel convened more than 100 companies across its value chain, along with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and representatives from government and academia, for a global Intel Sustainability Summit focused on defining a united approach to lower the industry’s collective environmental footprint.</p>
