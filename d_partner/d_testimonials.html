                            <p>"Defect inspection for contact lenses is difficult and inefficient since defects of
                                contact lens are usually non-rule based. Additionally, transparency of the contact lens
                                increases the inspection difficulty, accuracy, and overall manufacturing throughput.
                                ADLINK AI contact lens inspection solution uses well-validated EOS-i6000-M Series vision

                                finish an initial working product from two months to under two weeks by leveraging
                                ready-to-use ML models, easy-to-use tooling, and Inference Engine API, while still
                                achieving up to 10x inference throughput, even when it’s run on a single board computer
                                at the edge that’s accelerated by Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick. The OpenVINO

                                to our wearable-based solution. For certain functionality (e.g., herd counting), the
                                cost is reduced even further, as one camera is able to count the whole herd. OpenVINO
                                toolkit certainly has tremendous value proposition for certain use cases that will

                            <p>"The market for remote sensing space-based application is fundamentally limited by the up
                                and downlink bandwidth and the onboard compute capability on satellites. The work done
                                by ESA shows how the compute capability on these platforms can be vastly increased by
                                leveraging emerging COTS system-on-chip technologies. The orders of magnitude increase
                                in processing power can then be applied to consuming data at the source rather than on
                                the ground. This allows the deployment of value-added applications in space, which
                                consume a tiny fraction of the downlink bandwidth that would be otherwise required. The
