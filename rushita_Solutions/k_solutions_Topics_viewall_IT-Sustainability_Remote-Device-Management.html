                                IT teams today likely support a mix of company-owned and personal end user devices
                                running in a variety of locations, as well as independent devices such as digital signs
                                and conference room hubs. Having devices in your fleet that offer hardware-based,
                                business-class remote device management (RDM) capabilities can help to reduce support
                                costs and complexity and mitigate negative impacts to employee productivity. Whether
                                devices are on- or off-premises, new devices with hardware-based tools let businesses
                                deliver remote IT services, reducing deskside support and downtime.

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5">Benefits of Remote Device Management</h3>
                        <p>The increasing adoption of remote and hybrid work modes has led to challenges for IT
                            professionals. Tech support, maintenance, upgrades, and patches must be deployed remotely so
                            that all fleet devices perform as expected and the network is protected from unauthorized
                            users and cyber threats.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Today’s business employees expect a consistent technology experience whether they work
                            on-premises, at home, or on the road. IT can fulfill those user needs with high-performing,
                            highly manageable client PCs that provide integrated, business-class&nbsp;<a href="#">remote
                                monitoring and management (RMM)</a>&nbsp;capabilities, such as those offered on the
                            Intel® Core™ Ultra Processors with Intel vPro® Enterprise for Windows OS.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">The&nbsp;<a href="">Intel
                                vPro® Enterprise platform</a>&nbsp;provides integrated, hardware-enabled manageability
                            and security capabilities to help IT support and protect users and their devices wherever
                            they—or the IT staffers themselves—are located and even when a device is turned off or its
                            OS is not functioning.<sup>1</sup></p>
                        <p>For example, by providing hardware-level power control, the Intel vPro® Enterprise platform
                            enhances how patches, updates, and other routine maintenance can be administered remotely
                            and automatically to save time and reduce human error. IT can also support users’
                            peripherals remotely to provide more flexibility. This means home offices can be equipped
                            with docking stations, multiple monitors, printers, and other peripherals to enhance the
                            user experience without introducing new manageability challenges for the IT team.</p>
                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5">Why Hardware-Based Tools for Manageability?</h3>
                        <p>Hardware-based tools for enterprise remote management allow IT teams to administer processes
                            at both the software and hardware level. This means devices can be monitored, maintained,
                            and managed wherever they are.</p>
                        <p>Remote PC management gives IT teams a way to ensure devices have up-to-date operating systems
                            (OSs) and antivirus- and malware-scanning software. Off-hours patching helps minimize the
                            impact of updates on productivity.</p>
                        <p>Remote device management also empowers IT teams to transition from reactive to predictive
                            management by employing telemetry to troubleshoot, diagnose, and remediate problems.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5">Remote Management Use Cases</h3>
                        <p>Remote management helps keep devices secure and functioning optimally. A feature-rich device
                            platform can provide your IT team with a robust set of tools for several key use cases.</p>
                        <h3>OS and Software Updates</h3>
                        <p>OS updates and software deployment can be particularly challenging for IT. Ongoing security
                            threats can lead to more frequent updates, adding complexity for a rising number of
                            supported users and devices. With remote device management, IT teams can automate
                            high-volume OS updates and software rollouts to streamline the process on a convenient
                            schedule.</p>
                        <h3>Patch Management</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">With remote management, IT can implement automated&nbsp;<a
                                href="">patch
                                updates</a>&nbsp;that help enhance security. IT can wake systems and patch them during
                            off hours to minimize any disruptions to users’ productivity.</p>
                        <h3>Device Troubleshooting</h3>
                        <p>Remote device management solutions give IT teams the ability to be proactive when
                            troubleshooting, diagnosing, and resolving problems. IT can use real-time telemetry analysis
                            to diagnose a system’s problems and take quick action to resolve them. Telemetry can also be
                            applied in self-service help tools for employees who can implement remediation options
                            independently.</p>
                        <h3>Device Refresh</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Today’s businesses tend to&nbsp;<a
                                href="">refresh
                                devices</a>&nbsp;on a regular&nbsp;cadence to enhance performance. Modern devices also
                            include features that help to improve endpoint security and device manageability. Selecting
                            devices with integrated remote device management capabilities can enable your IT team to
                            take advantage of in-band and <a

                                Endpoint Management Assistant (Intel® EMA)</a>&nbsp;software, which gives IT the ability
                            to remotely and securely manage Intel® Active Management Technology devices beyond the
                            firewall via the cloud on known Wi-Fi networks.</p>
                        <p>A Forrester Consulting study found that the Intel vPro® platform’s device security and
                            management capabilities can result in a cost savings of USD 1.3 million over three years.
                            Further, automatic remote patch deployment with Intel® AMT can result in a risk-adjusted
                            cost savings of USD 81,000 over three years.<sup>2</sup></p>
                        <h3>Out-of-Band Management</h3>
                        <p>Remote devices can experience problems or become nonresponsive because of a corrupted driver,
                            an application crash, or an OS that won’t run or boot. Intel® AMT remote management
                            capabilities enable IT to easily handle these issues and manage client devices inside and
                            outside the firewall with an encrypted connection, using a wired LAN connection or a
                            wireless LAN Wi-Fi connection. Out-of-band connectivity operates independently of the OS,
                            allowing for a persistent connection to remote devices to administer remediation or updates.
                        </p>
                        <h3>KVM Over IP</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">IT administrators can operate a user’s remote keyboard, video, and mouse (KVM) controls
                            remotely over the internet. <a
                                href="">KVM
                                Over IP</a>&nbsp;saves time and money and enables IT teams to support the distributed
                            workforce. The Intel vPro® Enterprise platform for Windows OS provides Intel® AMT’s
                            out-of-band management with KVM remote control, enabling IT staff to take over a system’s
                            keyboard, monitor, and mouse via a trusted Wi-Fi connection. The remote access provides the
                            same level of control that would be available in an in-person support call, at lower cost
                            and with greater convenience.</p>
                        <h3>Remote Power-Up</h3>
                        <p>Remote power-up and power cycling capabilities enable other processes, including scheduled
                            maintenance, backups, and diagnostics in addition to overnight patch deployment. These
                            platform manageability features also provide for powering down remote systems not in use to
                            help conserve energy and reduce power costs—all without disrupting users.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5">Modern Manageability for Every Business</h3>
                        <p>Every business can benefit from remote management capabilities, from large enterprises to
                            small, growing organizations with limited IT resources and those that rely on a third-party
                            managed service provider for support.&nbsp;</p>
