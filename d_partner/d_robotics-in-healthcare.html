                        <p>
                            Robots in the medical field are transforming how surgeries are performed, streamlining
                            supply delivery and disinfection, and enabling providers to focus on engaging with and
                            caring for patients. Intel offers a diverse portfolio of technology for the development of
                            medical robots, including surgical-assistance, modular, and autonomous mobile robots.</p>
                        <p>Emerging in the 1980s, the first robots in the medical field provided surgical assistance via
                            robotic arm technologies. Over the years, artificial intelligence (AI)–enabled computer
                            vision and data analytics have transformed medical robots, expanding their capabilities into
                            many other areas of healthcare.</p>
                        <p>Robots are now used not only in the operating room but also in clinical settings to support
                            healthcare workers and enhance patient care. For example, hospitals and clinics are
                            deploying robots for a much wider range of tasks to help reduce exposure to pathogens during
                            the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
                        <p>The use of robotics and automation also extends to <a href="">research laboratories</a> where
                            they are used to automate manual, repetitive, and high-volume tasks so technicians and
                            scientists can focus their attention on more strategic tasks that make discoveries happen
                            faster.</p>
                        <p>Streamlined workflows and risk reduction provided by medical robotics offer value in many
                            areas. For example, robots can clean and prep patient rooms independently, helping limit
                            person-to-person contact in infectious disease wards. <a href="">Robots with AI-enabled
                                medicine identifier software</a> reduce the time it takes to identify, match, and
                            distribute medicine to patients in hospitals.</p>
                        <p>As technologies evolve, robots will function more autonomously, eventually performing certain
                            tasks entirely on their own. As a result, doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers will
                            be able to spend more time providing direct patient care.</p>

                            <p>Medical robots support minimally invasive procedures, customized and frequent monitoring
                                for
                                patients with chronic diseases, intelligent therapeutics, and social engagement for

                                patients. In addition, as robots alleviate workloads, nurses and other caregivers can
                                offer
                                patients more empathy and human interaction, which can promote long-term well-being.</p>
                            <p><b>Streamlined Clinical Workflows</b></p>
                            <p>Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) simplify routine tasks, reduce the physical demands on
                                human
                                workers, and ensure more consistent processes. These robots can address staffing
                                shortages
                                and challenges by keeping track of inventory and placing timely orders to help make sure
                                supplies, equipment, and medication are in stock where they are needed. Cleaning and
                                disinfection AMRs enable hospital rooms to be sanitized and ready for incoming patients
                                quickly, allowing workers to focus on patient-centric, value-driven work.</p>
                            <p><b>Safe Work Environment</b></p>
                            <p>To help keep healthcare workers safe, AMRs are used to transport supplies and linens in
                                hospitals where pathogen exposure is a risk. Cleaning and disinfection robots limit
                                pathogen
                                exposure while helping reduce hospital acquired infections (HAIs)—and hundreds of

                                facilities are already using them1. Social robots, a type of AMR, also help with heavy
                                lifting, such as moving beds or patients, which reduces physical strain on healthcare
                                workers.</p>

                            <p>As motion control technologies have advanced, surgical-assistance robots have become more
                                precise. These robots help surgeons achieve new levels of speed and accuracy while
                                performing complex operations with AI- and computer vision‒capable technologies. Some
                                surgical robots may</p>
                            <p>Surgeries performed with robotics assistance fall into two main categories:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Minimally invasive surgeries for the torso.</b>These include robotic
                                    hysterectomy,
                                    robotic prostatectomy, bariatric surgery, and other procedures primarily focused on
                                    soft
                                    tissues. After insertion through a small incision, these robots lock themselves into
                                    place, creating a stable platform from which to perform surgeries via remote
                                    control.
                                    Open surgery using large incisions was once the norm for most internal procedures.
                                    Recovery times were much longer, and the potential for infection and other
                                    complications
                                    was greater. Working manually through a button-sized incision is extremely
                                    difficult,
                                    even for an experienced surgeon. Surgical robot</li>
                                <li><b>Orthopedic surgeries.</b>Devices can be preprogrammed to perform common
                                    orthopedic
                                    surgeries, such as knee and hip replacements. Combining smart robotic arms, 3D
                                    imaging,
                                    and data analytics, these robots enable more predictable results by employing
                                    spatially
                                    defined boundaries to assist the surgeon. AI modeling enables robots to be trained
                                    in
                                    specific orthopedic surgeries, with precise direction for where to go and how to

                            <p>The ability to share a video feed from the operating room to other locations—near or
                                far—allows surgeons to benefit from consultations with other specialists in their field.
                                As
                                a result, patients have the best surgeons involved in their procedures.</p>
                            <p>The field of surgical robotics is evolving to make greater use of AI. Computer vision
                                enables
                                surgical robots to differentiate between types of tissue within their field of view. For
                                example, surgical robots now have the ability to help surgeons avoid nerves and muscles
                                during procedures2. High-definition 3D computer vision can provide surgeons with
                                detailed
                                information and enhanced performance during procedures. Eventually, robots will be able
                                to
                                take over small subprocedures, such as suturing or other defined tasks, under the
                                watchful
                                gaze of the surgeon.</p>
                            <p>Robotics also plays a key role in surgeon education. Simulation platforms use AI and
                                virtual
                                reality to provide surgical robotics training. Within the virtual environment, surgeons
                                can
                                practice procedures and hone skills using robotics controls.</p>

                            <p>Healthcare organizations often rely on AMRs because of their ability to assist with
                                critical
                                needs such as disinfection, telepresence, and delivery of medication and medical
                                supplies,
                                creating safe environments while freeing up staff to spend more time with patients. When
                                equipped with <a href="">light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems</a>, visual
                                compute, or
                                mapping capabilities, AMRs can self-navigate to patients in exam or hospital rooms,
                                allowing
                                clinicians to interact from afar. If an AMR is controlled by a remote specialist or
                                other
                                worker, it can accompany doctors as they make hospital rounds, allowing a specialist to
                                contribute via an on-screen consultation regarding patient diagnostics and care.</p>
                            <p>Some robots can assist professionals before a patient is checked in. For example, one <a
                                    href="">autonomous robot in Mexico</a>, developed by start-up Roomie, is being used
                                to
                                help medical staff with high-risk COVID-19 patients. Named RoomieBot, it triages
                                patients by
                                taking their temperature, blood oxygen level, and medical history when they arrive at
                                the
                                hospital. RoomieBot uses Intel-based technology, including AI algorithms that run on the
                                Intel® Movidius™ Vision Processing Unit (VPU), 8th Gen Intel® NUCs, and Intel®
                                RealSense™
                                cameras.</p>
                            <p>Other types of AMRs that are used in healthcare include service robots and social robots.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>Service Robots</b></p>
                            <p>Service robots relieve the daily burden on healthcare workers by handling routine
                                logistical
                                tasks. Many of these robots function autonomously and can send a report when they
                                complete a
                                task. These robots set up patient rooms, track supplies and file purchase orders,
                                restock
                                medical supply cabinets, and transport bed linens to and from laundry facilities. Having
                                some routine tasks performed by service robots gives healthcare workers more time to
                                focus
                                on immediate patient needs and can help with increasing job satisfaction. The <a
                                    href="">TUG
                                    Robot by Aethon</a> is a service robot doing just that. TUG can navigate complex and
                                changing environments to safely deliver linens to nursing units on both a scheduled and
                                on-demand basis.</p>
                            <p>Service robots can also help with cleaning and disinfection. These AMRs may use
                                ultraviolet
                                (UV) light, hydrogen peroxide vapors, or air filtration to help reduce infection and to
                                sanitize reachable places in a uniform way. An <a>autonomous mobile robot prototype</a>
                                developed by the start-up Akara is being tested for one of these routine yet essential
                                tasks: disinfecting contaminated surfaces using UV light. Its goal is to help hospitals
                                sanitize rooms and equipment, aiding in the fight against COVID-19.</p>
                            <p><b>Social Robots</b></p>
                            <p>Social robots interact directly with humans. These “friendly” robots can be used in
                                long-term
                                care environments to provide social interaction and monitoring. They may encourage
                                patients
                                to comply with treatment regimens or provide cognitive engagement, helping to keep
                                patients
                                alert and positive. They can also be used to offer directions to visitors and patients
                                inside the hospital environment. In general, social robots help reduce caregiver
                                workloads
                                and improve patients’ emotional well-being.</p>
