                        <p>Highly automated factories deliver enormous benefits for manufacturers. Yet machines,
                            equipment, and automation represent genuine risks. Add humans to the mix, and the stakes get
                            higher.</p>
                        <p>Humans are prone to errors. They get tired, become distracted, and occasionally make mistakes
                            and miscalculations. An inability to adhere to occupational safety guidelines can lead to
                            employee injuries—and worse.</p>
                        <p>For manufacturers, these errors and inefficiencies add up. They boost costs, undermine
                            productivity, pose regulatory and reputational risks, and put workers at further risk. The
                            result? Falls, slips, burns, cuts, bruises, blunt force injuries, and numerous other
                            problems.</p>

                        <p>Many factories use manual safety systems that rely on a human-centric and reactive approach.
                            These systems are costly to operate, slow to detect violations and problems, and human error
                            is a constant concern. Unfortunately, safety violations frequently slip through the cracks.
                        </p>
                        <p>As a result, a major beverage bottler in Asia turned to Intel and Aotu to build a framework
                            that could transform various manufacturing and safety inspection processes at ten regional

                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;" class="fw-lighter">Manual Processes = Errors and Problems</h2>
                        <p>Manufacturers understand that occupational safety is critical for business. However, manually
                            monitoring conditions, events, activities, and human behavior within facilities is typically
                            difficult and human-intensive. Machinery, equipment, vehicles, tanks, and other tools
                            represent a significant risk if they are not used correctly and if employees fail to follow
                            safety guidelines, such as using protective gear and following specific protocols and
                            procedures.</p>
                        <p>On average, a typical factory with a 10,000 square meter footprint requires approximately ten
                            or more safety personnel who require extensive and ongoing training on safety standards. In
                            many cases, the need for 24-hour safety supervision results in long working hours that in
                            turn, cause miscalculations and errors, safety violations, and injuries.</p>
                        <p>In addition, manufacturers often encounter regulatory issues that can put them at risk. In
                            many cases, fines can range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars per
                            violation. Longstanding and repeated problems can lead to government actions, including
                            lawsuits, that can top $1 million.1</p>
                        <p>Many manufacturers rely on video feeds to analyze processes and events along production
                            lines. Staff reviews these videos, looking for errors, infractions, or larger problems. For
                            this bottling manufacturer, the manual video review workload was significant and only
                            offered a reactive approach to safety.</p>
                        <p>To safeguard workers, specialists checked for several important things, including whether
                            workers on the line were wearing equipment and goggles correctly, handling machinery and
                            equipment correctly, staying in authorized areas, avoiding vehicle and robotic paths, and
                            following guidelines about how products and materials should be stored or transported.</p>
                        <p>The existing monitoring and inspection process was costly and time intensive. The task
                            required dozens of safety personnel working long hours. Workers had to stay focused at every
                            moment. If an inspector’s attention waned, an error or violation could go undetected. As
                            hours passed, the odds of missing a violation piled up.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;" class="fw-lighter">Unleashing the Power of Machine Vision and AI
                        </h2>
                        <p>There’s a better way. Machine vision and AI can automate monitoring and inspection—and
                            deliver instant notifications and alerts when something goes awry. Moreover, with real-time
                            visibility, an organization can build the safety framework with a best-in-class solution
                            that’s quickly and easily deployed—using prebuilt algorithms, existing cameras and
                            Industrial PCs (IPCs), and a browser-based dashboard.</p>
                        <p>The bottling company recognized the need to establish a more automated and proactive
                            monitoring framework. Ease of use and speed of implementation were critical success factors.
                            It required a technology framework that could be installed easily and, ideally, a system
                            that could automatically flag problems in real time, greatly reduce, or even eliminate human
                            errors and dramatically cut costs. And a system that would also allow the bottler to improve
                            training processes to help further reduce injuries and associated problems.</p>
                        <p>The company hoped to take the safety monitoring process into the digital age through machine
                            vision and AI—but without revamping its core IT systems. The bottler already had a great
                            deal of infrastructure in place. For example, one 37-acre site with 1,500 employees had 65
                            cameras. Another 11-acre site with 1,000 employees had 54 cameras. IoT-connected safety
                            cords and smart locks were also used for protection in high places and underground wells.
                            All of these devices and systems had to be integrated with the new system.</p>
                        <p>Recognizing that it could adopt a more advanced and evolved way to automate occupational
                            safety, in March of 2022, the bottler began exploring options and vendors—eventually
                            deciding to move forward with a sophisticated and “smart” factory production safety solution
                            from Aotu and Intel. Aotu’s automated video management solution, built on Intel®
                            architecture, offered an efficient way to evolve to smart manufacturing and an advanced
                            level of automated safety.</p>
                        <p>With Intel and Aotu on board, the company embarked on a safety transformation project to
                            revamp security processes at the ten factories covering half of China.</p>

                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;" class="fw-lighter">Transforming a Vision into a View
                        </h2>
                        <p>Aotu’s BrainFrame platform was the foundation for the new safety automation framework. The
                            platform optimized on Intel offers plug-and-play Vision Capsules, which are pre-designed and
                            pre-tested algorithms designed explicitly for factories optimized on Intel hardware. As a
                            result, the company could skip AI training and transition straight to a fully functional
                            safety automation system. From the moment the video stream from the existing cameras was
                            connected to the Aotu solution, it was possible to spot violations in real time.</p>
                        <p>The technology framework enabled achieving results within three months of initiating the
                            project. The bottler switched on the new machine vision systems at the first two sites in
                            June 2022.</p>
                        <p>Yet the goal to improve safety and operations didn’t stop there: the existing camera
                            infrastructure—including settings and configurations—was redesigned and updated to address
                            specific business scenarios. Together, these represented a complete set of safety procedures
                            that addressed behavioral issues, transport practices in the factory, the misuse of safety
                            equipment, and other general workplace issues.</p>
                        <p>Altogether, the bottler incorporated more than 1,000 existing cameras into the system. The
                            smart cameras oversaw manufacturing line practices and a variety of other areas and
                            activities, including:</p>

                        </h2>
                        <p>The safety platform is among the most advanced and simple to implement machine vision and AI
                            frameworks available. Jointly developed by Aotu and Intel, the intelligent video solution
                            for factory production safety is built on <a href="">11th Generation Intel® Core™
                                processor</a>-based
                            Industrial PCs, <a href="">Intel® Xeon® Scalable processor</a>-based edge servers, <a
                                href="">OpenVINO™ toolkit</a>, and
                            deep learning reference algorithms.</p>
                        <p>The no-code solution runs on Windows and Linux and provides VisionCapsule algorithms tested
                            in actual scenarios and integrated into the Aotu BrainFrame open AI vision operating system.
                            Using a Smart Vision AI Developers Kit eliminates the often complex and lengthy process of
                            developing algorithms—a task that can require up to 18 months.</p>
                        <p>Instead, it’s a turnkey process, like setting up a shop on Amazon or eBay. With this
                            platform, there’s no need to endure the typical process of developing specific vision
                            algorithms, building a video pipeline, running inference and application logic, recording
                            results, and setting up APIs to integrate everything with an existing system. This means
                            that a transformative safety inspection goes live in days or weeks.</p>
                        <p>The Aotu and Intel solution uses an industrial vision AI box/AI edge server, providing
                            Graphics User Interface (GUI) for AI video algorithm management and deployment and
                            supporting factory production safety. The Intel OpenVINO toolkit supports deep learning
                            algorithms that accelerate deep learning, AI, and machine vision while delivering powerful
                            AI computing power.</p>
                        <p>The bottling company’s final factory production safety solution included twelve customized
                            algorithms, covering eighteen key scenarios and nearly 1,000 supervision points in the
                            factory and surrounding spaces. What’s more, the Aotu video processing and AI inference
                            system provide a high level of programming and functional flexibility through a no-code
                            platform that supports Python, C/C++, and SQL.</p>
                        <p>The easy installation and extreme flexibility of the Aotu and Intel frameworks were
                            especially appealing. The bottler has the flexibility to install Intel’s OpenVINO and the
                            Aotu BrainFrame platform on any combination of computers with a wired or wireless TCP/IP
                            connection. The VisionCapsules Library, with built-in computer vision algorithms and deep
                            learning models, made it possible to run algorithms and start inference in seconds.</p>
                        <p>For the bottler, this meant they could layer the advanced machine vision and AI framework
                            atop an existing IT infrastructure. There was no need to revamp the IT infrastructure or
                            software in any significant way—or undergo major changes to actual safety processes. The
                            company simply needed to <a href="">add Intel® Core™ i7 processor</a>-based Industrial PCs
                            to further
                            extend the Aotu solution’s capabilities. This avoided disruption and the myriad problems and
                            costs that can stem from a technology initiative.</p>
                        <p>The result was an ability to monitor real-time video automatically, with immediate warnings
                            and alerts when a violation occurs, including light and sound alarms, smart lock alarms, and
                            other mechanisms that remind people to act or react. Staff can also initiate a 30-second
                            replay of a suspected violation to confirm that it took place or view the event more
                            closely.</p>
                        <p>The benefits don’t stop there. The videos and the data collected from the Aotu system also
                            help improve safety content and training. For example, the bottler has achieved 100 percent
                            real-time scanning for safety compliance, which exceeded its initial objectives. Now the
                            safety staff spends less than five minutes daily focusing on video feeds and the associated
                            data. As a result, they’re focused on more strategic tasks, such as further improving
                            training methods. In the future, when the bottler is interested in connecting with
                            additional existing or new factory applications, Intel® Edge Insights for Industrial (EII)
                            software is available to make that integration easier. The software incorporates Docker, an
                            open source microservices architecture that speeds development and includes advanced AI
                            analysis.</p>
