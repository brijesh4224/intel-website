                                    The General Exploration (replaced with the Microarchitecture Exploration in the
                                    latest product versions) analysis type in Intel® VTune™ Amplifier is used to detect
                                    microarchitectural hardware bottlenecks in an application or system. General
                                    Exploration uses hardware event counters to detect and locate issues and presents
                                    the data in a user-friendly and actionable format. This article will explain the
                                    mechanisms used in this analysis, a few best-known-methods for interpreting the

                                <p>
                                    The majority of the data collected and displayed in the General Exploration profile
                                    is based on hardware events collected by the Performance Monitoring Units (PMU) on
                                    the CPU. These PMU counters are hardware registers that can be programmed to count
                                    various events, for example cache misses or mispredicted branches. You can find
                                    details about the PMUs and events in the
                                    <a href="" class="Vk_text_underline_dots VK_a">

                                    VTune Amplifier collects the events in a mode known as Event-Based Sampling (EBS).
                                    In EBS, each PMU register is programmed to count a specific event and given a
                                    sample-after value (SAV). When the event occurs, the counter increments, and when it
                                    reaches the SAV, an interrupt fires and some data is collected, e.g. instruction
                                    pointer (IP), call stack, PID, etc... For example, if we programmed a PMU to count
                                    the L2 Cache Miss event with a SAV of 2000, on the 2000th L2 cache miss an interrupt
                                    would occur, the data would be collected, and VTune Amplifier would attribute all
                                    2000 cache misses to the singe IP collected in the interrupt handler. Then the PMU
                                    would reset and start counting to 2000 again.

                                    The fact that all 2000 cache misses are attributed to a single IP is the reason that
                                    this technique is called Event-Based

                                    </b>
                                    It is unlikely that all 2000 cache misses are actually caused by that single
                                    instruction, however, if enough samples are collected in this manner, the results
                                    should be a statistical representation of the actual behavior. When sufficient
                                    symbol information and source code is available, these instruction pointers can be
                                    resolved to specific modules, functions, and often times lines of code within an
                                    application.

                                    There are hundreds of events that can be collected on a given microarchitecture, and
                                    these events can change from generation to generation. The General Exploration
                                    analysis is designed to harness the expert knowledge of the architects and abstract
                                    away the complexities of selecting which events to collect and present the user with
                                    understandable metrics that remain consistent across platforms. To do so, it is
                                    based on the Top-Down Analysis Method [1], which is briefly mentioned in next
                                    section. General Exploration collects approximately 60 events on recent
                                    microarchitectures. There are a limited number of PMU counters (usually four per
                                    logical core) so this set of events must be multiplexed in order to collect them all
                                    in a single profile. This means that four events are collected for some period of
                                    time, then they are swapped out for a different four events, and this process
                                    repeats continuously for the entire profile. The behavior of specific events must be
                                    estimated during the times when that event is not being collected. This multiplexing
                                    can introduce issues, which are described in the complexities section later in the
                                    article.

                                    After running a General Exploration analysis you are presented with a summary of all
                                    the data collected. In addition to some common performance data such as elapsed
                                    time, the majority of the General Exploration data are metrics based on the hardware
                                    events described above. A

                                    is a combination of events into some useful value. For example, if we divide the
                                    Clockticks (CPU_CLK_UNHALTED.THREAD event) by Instructions (INST_RETIRED.ANY event),
                                    we get the commonly used metric Cycles per Instruction (CPI).

                                    The metrics in VTune Amplifier are organized in a hierarchical fashion which is used
                                    to identify microarchitectural bottlenecks. This hierarchy and methodology is known
                                    as the Top-Down Analysis Method – a simplified, accurate and fast method to identify
                                    critical bottlenecks at the architecture and microarchitecture levels. Frequent
                                    performance bottlenecks are organized in a hierarchical structure and their cost is
                                    weighted using microarchitecture-independent metrics. As a result, the hierarchy is
                                    consistent and forward-compatible across processor generations which reduces the
                                    high learning curve traditionally required to understand new microarchitectures and
                                    their model-specific events. A detailed description of this methodology can be found
                                    in the IEEE paper [1]. A useful white paper is also available at

                                    After running an analysis, it’s important to focus on the hotspots within your
                                    application. These will have the largest counts for the CPU_CLK_UNHALTED.THREAD
                                    event. Next, focus on metrics that are highlighted in the GUI at the highest level
                                    of the hierarchy. Highlighted metrics have values outside a predefined threshold
                                    that represents when performance starts to be impacted negatively. Expand the
                                    highlighted metrics to see sub metrics that relate to the parent. Again look for
                                    highlighted metrics to identify performance impacts and continue expanding the
                                    highlighted metrics. Start by focusing on the lowest level of the hierarchy that has
                                    a highlighted metric. Use the hover text and documentation to understand the meaning
                                    of various metrics and how they can affect performance. The tuning guides include
                                    lots of suggestions for improving performance depending on which metrics are
                                    highlighted. If no metrics are highlighted at the lowest level, focus on the
                                    highlighted level above and try to understand what causes the performance issue
                                    indicated by that metric. After making code changes, rerun a General Exploration
                                    analysis to see if they have affected performance and how the metrics characterize
                                    the optimized code. You can use the VTune Amplifier GUI to compare results
                                    side-by-side. This performance tuning process is iterative, and can continue as long
                                    as the developer is willing to invest the time. Generally, the first fixes will have
                                    the most impact on performance, and subsequent changes will begin to have
                                    diminishing returns.

                                    One such set of complexities are introduced by the use of Intel® Hyper-Threading
                                    Technology, sometimes referred to as an implementation of simultaneous
                                    multithreading (SMT). In a system running with SMT enabled, each physical core has
                                    additional hardware which allows it to appear as two logical processors, although
                                    most of the hardware is still shared. You can imagine that designing PMUs and events
                                    for this case can be complex. Some events become less accurate when SMT is enabled
                                    because it can be difficult to distinguish the logical core responsible for the
                                    event. Additionally, calculating metrics using these events is complex because
                                    metrics make some assumptions about the underlying hardware. For example, a modern
                                    Intel CPU can allocate and retire four micro-operations (uops) per cycle. Therefore
                                    the ideal CPI would be 0.25. However, when SMT is enabled, this limit of four uops
                                    per cycle still holds true for the core, each SMT thread must share the allocate and
                                    retire resources. Thus, in an application with SMT enabled and multiple software
                                    threads consistently running, i.e. very few stalls due to memory accesses or port
                                    contention, a per-logical core (SMT core) CPI of 0.5 is the best you can do. And
                                    most applications are a mix of parallel and serial. Because of this, some metric
                                    values may vary when SMT is enabled and should be interpreted with this in mind. The
                                    main metrics to note that are affected by SMT are the top-level metrcs (categories):
                                    Retiring, Bad Speculation, Back-End Bound, and Front-End bound. The effects of SMT
                                    are proportional to amount that both SMT threads are executing simultaneously on a
                                    core and competing for the same resource, e.g. allocation slots. In the case with
                                    lots of simultaneous execution, the Retiring, Bad Speculation, and Front-End Bound
                                    metrics can be underestimated and Back-End Bound will be overestimated. In a
                                    worst-case scenario, these metrics can be off by ~1X, however the variance is
                                    generally less than that. Additionally, VTune Amplifier has thresholds built in to
                                    highlight metrics when they may indicate a performance issue, and in most cases this
                                    variance will not affect whether a metric is highlighted. It’s important to be aware
                                    of how SMT may be affecting your results, and if you suspect such effects, try
                                    running an analysis with SMT disabled in the BIOS.

                                    Another complexity introduced by EBS is the event skid that occurs when PMU
                                    interrupt handlers collect the Instruction Pointer (IP) that caused the event. Due
                                    to complexities in the hardware and delays in interrupt processing, the IP collected
                                    at the time of the interrupt handler which is assigned to a given event may skid to
                                    several IPs later in the execution then when the event actually occurred. In the
                                    case that metrics are being evaluated at a module or function level, this is
                                    generally not an issue because the IP will often still be in the same module or
                                    function. However, if you are looking at source lines or assembly instructions, the
                                    event counts and metrics values may skid to a line or instruction later in the
                                    binary. If metric values don’t seem to make sense, look at the few source lines
                                    before and think about whether skid may be affecting the values and whether it makes
                                    sense for the metrics to be associated with a previous line in the program. A
                                    special case of event skid can occur on branch instructions where events may get
                                    associated to branch targets which may be far away in the binary. Pay special
                                    attention to this effect if it looks like metrics associated with branch targets are
                                    actually from branch sources. Some events can be collected in a “precise” mode.
                                    These events are usually denoted with a _PS at the end of their name, for example
                                    BR_INST_RETIRED.ALL_BRANCHES_PS. These events usually have a reduced skid of just
                                    one instruction. They are attributed to the IP directly after the eventing IP -
                                    often referred to as IP+1. It is not always trivial to determine the previous IP, as
                                    in the branch case described above, so VTune Amplifier cannot do this automatically.
                                    If you’re profiling on a 4th generation Core™ processor or later, there is a fix for
                                    IP+1 issue and the eventing IP is reported. When looking at event locations for
                                    precise events on older processors, keep this IP+1 skid in mind.

                                    which requires event multiplexing, as described above. This multiplexing can cause

                                    One more issue to be aware of when doing EBS with VTune Amplifier is the effect
                                    interrupt handlers and masking interrupts can have on sampling. As described above,
                                    samples are counted through the use of an interrupt and interrupt handler. If the
                                    platform or application being analyzed has lots of time spent with interrupts
                                    masked, for example in other interrupt handlers, samples cannot be collected during
                                    that time. This also means that interrupt handlers themselves cannot be fully
                                    profiled by EBS. If multiple PMU interrupts arrive while interrupts are masked, only
                                    the last one will be handled when interrupts are eventually unmasked. This issue is
                                    often seen as many more samples than expected being attributed to the kernel idle
                                    loop, where interrupts are regularly masked and unmasked.
