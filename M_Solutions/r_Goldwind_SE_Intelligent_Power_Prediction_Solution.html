                        <p>Growing acceptance of clean energy concepts has led to renewable energies such as wind power
                            and photovoltaics (PV) playing an increasingly important role in the energy sector. Data
                            from China's National Energy Administration (NEA) showed that wind power production
                            nationwide in the first half of 2019 grew by 11.5% year-on-year, with installed PV capacity
                            increasing by 20%.1</p>
                        <p>Unlike conventional energy sources, new energies such as wind and PV are greatly impacted by
                            environmental factors. The random and variable nature of wind and sunlight create tough
                            challenges for grid stability and safety. Recent years have seen increased adoption of
                            emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and
                            cloud computing by the new energy industry. It can be seen that smart techniques are being
                            applied to solve the above challenges and will become the preferred choice for new energy
                            enterprises seeking to take the lead in future green energy development.</p>
                        <p>Aiming to lead the way in new energy digitalization and intelligence, Beijing Goldwind Smart
                            Energy Services Co., Ltd. (“Goldwind SE”) is committed to developing new energy IoT systems
                            and solutions and is one of the important pioneers on the path to green energy. Goldwind SE
                            is combining deep learning and machine learning with data from turbine-level weather
                            forecasting and wind trajectory simulation to develop an innovative smart power prediction
                            solution based on multi-model integration. For this purpose, the company has established a
                            close partnership with Intel to build a distributed architecture based on Analytics Zoo,
                            Intel’s unified big data analytics and AI platform. This distributed architecture
                            encompasses everything from feature engineering, capture of impact factors on predictions,
                            multi-model integration, and customized policy updates. Optimizations were also made for
                            time-series nature of prediction data. The innovative solution co-developed by Goldwind SE
                            and Intel has been subsequently validated through a series of field tests and has since been
                            applied with satisfactory results.</p>

                        <p>Clean renewable energies such as wind and PV are becoming increasingly popular. However,
                            environmental factors such as wind speed, wind direction, sunlight, temperature, and air
                            pressure during the power generation process all have major impacts on power systems. This
                            results in challenges for generation equipment and connected grids in terms of operational
                            efficiency and equipment safety. Therefore, predicting the power output from new energy
                            sources helps the dispatching system regulate and optimize power generation plans and
                            improve peak regulation capability. Such predictions also help reduce wind/PV curtailment
                            and lower operating costs so as to enhance the competitiveness of power enterprises.</p>
                        <p>Historical data and human experience have been traditionally used by energy companies to
                            predict power generation. This approach is marred with issues, including low accuracy and
                            high volatility. Advances in IT have led to growing application of informationized and
                            digitized prediction methods in power prediction. The increased availability of AI
                            algorithms and greater computing power support has made it possible to implement AI-based
                            prediction methods that leverage historical big data. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and
                            Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), for example, have been proven to effectively improve the
                            operating efficiency of power systems.</p>
                        <p>With its extensive experience in smart power prediction, Goldwind SE believes that existing
                            AI prediction methods can be optimized even further. On one hand, there is still room for
                            improvement in both the accuracy and stability of singular deep learning and machine
                            learning methods. On the other hand, power enterprises are facing IT challenges during a
                            series of model building processes such as feature engineering and
                            short-term/ultra-short-term online/offline training, etc. involved in prediction systems.
                            Goldwind SE is eager to introduce new technologies and construct a next generation smart
                            power prediction solution, which is more accurate and easier to deploy, for industry users.

                        <h4>Integrated Multi-model Power Prediction Solution with Weather Forecasting Data</h4>
                        <p>The smart power prediction process is generally split into modules for edge data collection,
                            storage, governance, inference, and AI training. As shown in Figure 1, the edge sensors
                            deployed at the wind turbine and PV inverter transmit comprehensive environmental and
                            operational data such as wind speed, temperature, power, and electricity output to the data
                            center for storage. The data is then screened for validity using the data governance module.
                            An appropriate deep learning or machine learning framework is then used to combine the
                            filtered data with historical data for training and inference. The resulting model is used
                            to map the relationships between environmental factors and power, power and power, and
                            output and power over a certain amount of time.</p>

                        <i>Figure 1 Traditional AI power prediction process.</i>
                        <p>It can be seen that traditional AI power prediction utilizes a single AI algorithm model to
                            carry out training and inference on data samples for environmental parameters, power, and
                            output. While this approach may provide accurate predictions for relatively short period
                            (within the next 15-30 minutes), prediction accuracy drops off as the lead time increases.
                            Even the ultra-short-term predictions that are most often used in power prediction systems
                            for power generation need to cover the power output for the next 4 hours. In other words,
                            prediction systems must maintain a high level of accuracy and stability for the next 16 time
                            points (15 minutes = 1 time point).</p>
                        <p>Through research and tests, Goldwind SE found that the prediction accuracy and stability
                            could be effectively improved by introducing just two technologies into the existing smart
                            prediction systems. The first step is to integrate weather forecasting into power prediction
                            systems. As the traditional approach uses existing power data to predict future power
                            output, time series data was lacking. Weather forecasting data effectively makes up for this
                            shortfall with time series data that ensures consistent prediction accuracy for each future
                            time point. The other technology introduced is multi-model integration. That means different
                            deep learning or machine learning models are selected and combined with weather forecasting
                            data according to actual needs to increase system prediction accuracy.</p>
                        <figure>

                        <i>Figure 2 Turbine-level weather forecasting and wind trajectory simulation.</i>
                        <p>Power prediction also requires highly exact parameters and metrics from weather forecasting
                            data, including fine spatial resolution, qualitative and quantitative feature analysis, and
                            stable forecasting accuracy. To ensure stability and accuracy of the new solution through
                            combined forecasts, Goldwind SE partnered with authoritative institutions such as the China
                            Meteorological Administration (CMA) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
                            Forecasts (ECMWF). As shown in Figure 2, the scale of turbine-level weather forecasting
                            (left) was refined from the standard 9 km to a micro scale of 100 m. Wind trajectory
                            simulation (right) is now capable of quantitative analysis of actual wind paths.</p>
                        Analytics Zoo is a fusion of Intel’s innovations in big data analytics and AI. As shown in
                        Figure 4, it helps Goldwind SE integrate Spark, TensorFlow, Keras, and other software and
                        frameworks used in its new solution into a single pipeline. This approach helps Goldwind SE
                        integrate all data storage, data processing, training, and inference processes into a unified
                        infrastructure, greatly improving the deployment efficiency, resource utilization, and
                        scalability of its new solution while reducing hardware management and system maintenance costs.
                        <i>Figure 3 Architecture of integrated multi-model prediction solution with weather forecasting
                            data.</i>
                        <p>The inclusion of high-quality weather forecasting data allowed Goldwind SE to build a
                            prediction solution based on multi-model integration. The solution starts by mining big data
                            for feature engineering and to capture prediction impact factors such as wind speed, wind
                            direction, and temperature. As shown in Figure 3, weather forecasting data from different
                            sources such as CMA and the ECMWF are combined with parameters provided by multiple deep
                            learning and machine learning algorithms into a new method such as SVM+CMA.</p>
                        <p>The new solution can provide various other combinations as needed. The algorithmic models of
                            each combination can continue to train its sub-models using the latest data. These
                            sub-models can then undergo regular self-learning, updates, and replacement to increase
                            prediction system accuracy through continuous iterations.</p>

                            <h3>Building a Distributed Power Prediction Architecture Using Analytics Zoo</h3>
                            <li>The incorporation of weather forecasting data is the key advantage of Goldwind SE's new
                                solution. It is widely understood that weather forecasting data is a classic example of
                                time series data as its data values change over time. Choosing a system architecture
                                more suited to processing time series data naturally increases the accuracy and
                                stability of the prediction system. It is here that Analytics Zoo, Intel’s unified big
                                data analytics and AI platform, provides a unified end-to-end distributed solution that
                                improves the system efficiency and scalability in both development and deployment. Its
                                unique functionality and advantages in time series data analytics offers significant
                                boosts to new solutions as well.</li>
                            <li>Analytics Zoo is a fusion of Intel’s innovations in big data analytics and AI. As shown
                                in Figure 4, it helps Goldwind SE integrate Spark, TensorFlow, Keras, and other software
                                and frameworks used in its new solution into a single pipeline. This approach helps
                                Goldwind SE integrate all data storage, data processing, training, and inference
                                processes into a unified infrastructure, greatly improving the deployment efficiency,
                                resource utilization, and scalability of its new solution while reducing hardware
                                management and system maintenance costs.</li>

                        <p>Analytics Zoo is also capable of making effective use of the many underlying software
                            accelerator libraries offered by Intel, such as Intel® Math Kernel Library (Intel® MKL), and
                            Intel® Math Kernel Library for Deep Neural Network (Intel® MKL-DNN), providing further
                            optimization to the upper-layer power prediction solution. TensorFlow and Keras models can
                            be transparently expanded to big data clusters to improve the ease in which users can
                            utilize distributed architecture in their training or inference solution for further
                            enhancement.</p>
                        <p>In addition to its unified end-to-end platform architecture, the primary advantage provided
                            by Analytics Zoo is its range of functions and features for time series data analysis.
                            Analytics Zoo provides complete solutions for different time series analysis applications
                            such as time series prediction, anomaly detection, feature learning, and clustering,
                            allowing Goldwind SE to easily introduce more combinations of prediction methods to its new
                            solution. Analytics Zoo also offers an extensive array of pre-configured components for time
                            series data.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Common deep learning and machine learning models for power prediction: LSTM,
                                Encoder-Decoder, MtNet, ARIMA, etc.</li>
                            <li>Common data pre-processing and feature engineering methods for power prediction:
                                Datetime features, Time diff, Log-transform, Rolling window, etc.</li>
                            <li>Common anomaly detection methods for power prediction: Percentile, Distribution-based,
                                Uncertainty based, Autoencoder, etc.</li>
                            <p>In addition to the above components, Analytics Zoo also provided the new solution with
                                AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) methods for automated feature selection, model
                                selection, and hyper parameter optimization. This improves the ability of the prediction
                                model to fit variation period of power output.</p>
                            <p>Goldwind SE and Intel conducted field trials at a number of PV test sites throughout the
                                country to validate the new distributed power prediction solution based on Analytics
                                Zoo. The validation program used a monthly cycle. In each PV test site, 30,000 records
                                in one hour were used to perform 5,000 times of iterative optimizations for LSTNet model
                                and the power prediction data for the next 2 hours was then returned within 50ms. The
                                validation outcomes seen in Figure 5 show that the prediction accuracy of the new
                                solution reached 79.41%,2 a 20% increase over the 59% accuracy of the old solution.</p>
