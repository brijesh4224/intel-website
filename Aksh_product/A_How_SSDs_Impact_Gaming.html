                                        storage matters. But judging the performance impact of different drives isn’t as
                                        simple as checking the benchmarks for new CPUs and GPUs.</p>
                                    <p class="V_pv">It’s easy to wonder: Is “SSD gaming” noticeably faster than “HDD
                                        gaming”? Do SSDs have benefits beyond improving boot times?</p>

                                        basics and explore the impact of storage on gaming.</p>

                                            looking at storage drives, so let’s start there.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">You’ll need a significant amount of space to play modern PC
                                            games. Install sizes have grown in recent years, with recent titles like
                                            Call of Duty: Modern Warfare taking up over 200GB by themselves.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Why do game install sizes continue to increase? It’s in part
                                            because they feature more high-resolution assets, such as 4K textures, that
                                            have a larger memory footprint. Although developers use image compression
                                            algorithms to reduce the size of stored assets, more high-res textures still
                                            mean more space used. The Unreal 4 engine, for example, <a href="#"
                                                class="V_andecor_r">specifies</a> that a single 4K texture may take up
                                            10.6-20.3MB of space using supported compression.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv ">Games vary in the ways in which they compress art assets,
                                            video, and audio. Because decompressing assets like audio files creates more
                                            work for the CPU, developers have sometimes chosen to use uncompressed
                                            assets (increasing install size) so that their game runs smoother on
                                            lower-spec machines.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">While not every game takes up as much space as Modern Warfare or
                                            Red Dead Redemption 2 (150GB), AAA titles will likely continue to grow in
                                            install size as the quality and complexity of assets increases.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Given that Windows 10 requires 20GB of space, it’s easy to see
                                            that some smaller drives—such as a 256GB SSD — could be almost full after
                                            installing just one AAA game. No matter what storage solution you choose, if
                                            you want to install multiple new releases at once, you’ll likely want at
                                            least 500GB for your primary drive.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Beyond that, it’s up to personal preference. Some players only
                                            want a couple of titles installed on their gaming PC at a time, while others
                                            will want several terabytes of space to manage their game library and save
                                            gameplay highlights.

                                            reliability. We’ll walk through some of the reasons this performance gap
                                            exists below.</p>

                                        <p class="V_pv ">HDDs use moving parts. Inside an HDD, an actuator arm moves
                                            over circular tracks on a spinning platter to retrieve or save data.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv ">Because of the arm’s seek time and the platter’s rotational
                                            latency, HDDs have slower random read/write times than SSDs. When you’re
                                            playing, these delays can mean a longer wait to load up an individual level
                                            or assets, as well as momentary hitches and stutters as the game pulls new
                                            assets from the disk.

                                            using magnetic media, most SSDs use NAND flash memory that enables superior
                                            read/write speeds and lower latency than HDDs can achieve.

                                            be
                                            standard in the next generation of gaming consoles. There are clear reasons
                                            for their widespread adoption:
                                        </p>
                                        <ul class="V_pv">
                                            <li>Faster OS boot times. Installing an SSD means less time waiting for your
                                                operating system to start before you can play games or do anything else.
                                                A new PC with an SSD often boots in a fraction of the time when compared
                                                to an HDD. SSDs’ superior data transfer speed can save you minutes of
                                                waiting.</li>
                                            <li>Faster load times. The most dramatic difference between SSDs and HDDs is
                                                the time you’ll spend waiting for games to load. The benefit is clear:
                                                SSDs can save you a few minutes of loading time in every play session
                                                and hours of waiting in the long term.</li>
                                            <li>Smoother gameplay. Many games perform thousands of tiny read and write
                                                operations as you play, which can result in hundreds of megabytes of
                                                data transfers. Upgrading to an SSD won’t increase your FPS, but it can
                                                result in an improvement in some open-world titles with game engines
                                                that load in new areas and textures as you play. On HDDs, the seek time
                                                of the arm’s read/write head and the rotational latency of the magnetic
                                                platter below it create the latency behind these hitches. By comparison,
                                                the greater bandwidth and reduced latency of SSDs help them rapidly
                                                access the requested data and avoid hitching.</li>

                                            HDD-bound consoles, developers couldn’t take full advantage of the speed of
                                            SSDs.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv ">The next generation of consoles will change that — both use
                                            NVMe SSDs. In addition, technologies like Microsoft’s DirectStorage API let
                                            games make vastly more I/O requests. That means that instead of building
                                            around the I/O bottlenecks caused by slow storage, creators can now finally
                                            scale their games up to the capabilities of NVMe drives.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">This means open game worlds with more objects in view, thanks to
                                            a larger asset streaming budget. Sections of the level designed to slow the
                                            player down — like narrow corridors or elevators — might no longer be needed
                                            to conceal the loading of new textures and zones.
