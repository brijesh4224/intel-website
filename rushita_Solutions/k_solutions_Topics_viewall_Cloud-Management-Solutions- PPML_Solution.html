                        <h2 class="k_26px mt-5 fw-lighter pt-4">Overview</h2>
                        <p>Innovative digital technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence (AI) are reshaping the world rapidly. They are changing the social and economic development model by bringing more possibilities to people’s lives. Knowing that data has become one of the most important assets, an increasing number of enterprises are seizing the trend of data-centric transformation. Meanwhile, however, their data elements are also faced with serious security risks in the process of storage, processing, and circulation both inside and outside organizations. Therefore, protecting data security is now one of the most important factors deciding success or failure of digital transformation.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Based on <a href="#">Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX)</a>, Intel has built BigDL PPML (Privacy Preserving Machine Learning) to secure the end-to-end big data and AI pipeline. In collaboration with Alibaba Cloud DataTrust, Intel has verified the PPML solution in its end-to-end workflow and relevant business scenarios and demonstrated the best practice for rapidly building end-to-end privacy-preserving applications based on BigDL PPML.</p>

                        <h2 class="k_26px mt-5 fw-lighter pt-4">Background: Data Fusion for Big Data and AI Challenged by Security Risks</h2>
                        <p>Digital transformation, while highlighting the importance of data value and accelerating data flow, results in complex data storage, circulation, and processing among multiple parties. It is difficult for a single organization to prepare all data, especially those required by AI and big data applications. Therefore, multiple parties should cooperate to realize data convergence for utilization. Take the training of financial AI algorithms as an example, individual financial institutions cannot meet the needs with their own data. In this case, different parties can work together to create and maintain AI models and share data eventually.</p>
                        <p>However, as a result of the increasing need for cross-institutional and cross-industry data fusion, analysis, and modeling, data security risks have also accumulated dramatically. On the one hand, data can be copied and spread easily, making it difficult to track them once shared in the traditional security model. On the other hand, continuous data flow will lead to problems such as unclear division of responsibilities, difficult authority control, and hard tracking of accountability. Therefore, data security and reliability become top priority.</p>
                        <p>However, traditional security solutions to AI and big data applications often face the following challenges:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Joint analysis and modeling require frequent data sharing and convergence, while traditional data security solutions are designed to protect data at rest and in transit, instead of data in use. As a result, some security threats may break through the lines of security defense, causing incidents such as data leakage.</li>
                            <li>AI and big data applications involve multiple processes, such as data input, data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning. Vulnerabilities in any of these processes may lead to serious consequences including data leakage. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure end-to-end security.</li>
                            <li>Attacks against AI and big data encompass a wide range of known and unknown security threats, as well as a variety of attack techniques and tools. However, traditional solutions generally work on the software level, yet hardly protect the bottom layer of hardware, which hinders further improvement in its protection efficiency.</li>
                            <li>Data security measures often resort to relatively complex calculations, which may lead to certain performance losses and a negative impact on the operational efficiency of data bank.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="k_26px mt-5 fw-lighter pt-4">Solution: Alibaba Cloud E2E PPML Based on BigDL PPML</h2>
                        <p>To help enterprises better protect end-to-end privacy of AI and big data applications, Alibaba Cloud and Intel worked together to validate Alibaba Cloud E2E PPML in end-to-end workflow and related business scenarios by synergizing BigDL PPML and Alibaba Cloud DataTrust.</p>

                        <h2 class="k_26px mt-5 fw-lighter pt-4">BigDL PPML</h2>
                        <p>BigDL, a unified open-source AI solution platform from Intel, makes it easier for data scientists and data engineers to build end-to-end, distributed AI applications. Using Intel® SGX, Intel’s Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), and integrating with other hardware and software security measures, BigDL has built a distributed PPML platform to protect end-to-end distributed AI pipeline (from data ingestion, data analysis, all the way to machine learning and deep learning).</p>
                        <p>As an important underlying technology of BigDL PPML, Intel SGX bypasses a system’s operating system (OS) and virtual machine (VM) software layers to provide significant additional protection against many of these attacks. It adds data security and addresses the need for more confidential computing. Intel SGX offers hardware-based memory encryption that isolates specific application code and data in memory. Intel SGX allows user-level code to allocate private regions of memory, called Enclaves, which are designed to be protected from processes running at higher privilege levels.<br>
                            &nbsp;</p>
                            <div>

                            <p><em>Figure 2. Intel® SGX protects at the bottom layer of hardware.</em></p>
                            <p>Intel SGX is rigorously tested and widely deployed hardware-based data center trusted execution environment (TEE), with the smallest available attack surface within the system. In addition to helping defend against software-based attacks, Intel SGX’s attestation mechanisms also help users verify that their application and hardware have not been compromised and their processor has the latest security updates.<br>
                                Developers can use BigDL PPML platform to:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Develop and run standard distributed AI applications (such as big data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning) with encrypted data;</li>
                                    <li>Protect computing processes and corresponding memory data using hardware-based security technologies such as Intel SGX; and</li>
                                    <li>Provide end-to-end security and privacy protection for AI applications, for example, creating and authenticating a trusted cluster in a K8s environment with Intel SGX hardware; offering encryption and decryption capabilities for distributed data via Key Management System (KMS); and enabling secure distributed computing and data communication based on technologies such as Intel SGX, encryption and decryption, TLS, and security authentication.</li>
                                </ul>

                        <p><em>Figure 4. BigDL PPML based end-to-end secure computing workflow.</em></p>
                        <p>In the above end-to-end secure computing workflow based on BigDL PPML, the functions of each process are described as follows:</p>
                        <div>
                            <img src="../img/rushita_img/micro11.jpg" alt="" width="100%">
                        </div>
                        <p>BigDL PPML solution integrates the above workflow schemes that include: Intel SGX-based trusted-computing core components supporting Apache Spark, Spark SQL, machine learning, and deep learning; abstracted client API of attestation service; abstracted client API of key management service; encrypted data transmission and storage; and customized K8s container images.</p>
                        <p>By using the above pre-configured workflow, developers can focus more on the development of business logic and use BigDL PPML to ensure the end-to-end security and privacy of their applications. Users can significantly improve the development efficiency of private computing applications and greatly shorten the time to private computing solutions.</p>
                        <h2 class="k_26px mt-5 fw-lighter pt-4">Application Practice</h2>
                        <p>Alibaba Cloud DataTrust runs the Spark SQL instance to validate the BigDL PPML solution. The basic steps are as follows:</p>
                        <p><em>1. Create a secure ECS instance on Alibaba Cloud</em></p>
                        <p>Create a g7t instance with encrypted memory as shown in Figure 5. After creation, confirm specifications of the instance in the list below:</p>
                        <div>
                            <img src="../img/rushita_img/micro12.jpg" alt="" width="100%">
                        </div>
                        <p><em>Figure 6. ECS Instance Specifications.</em></p>
                        <p><em>2. Prepare operation environment for BigDL PPML</em></p>
                        <p>Firstly, deploy Kubernetes cluster, Intel SGX plugin and NFS service, obtain the docker image of BigDL PPML, and generate security keys and passwords. Secondly, perform Kubernetes security configuration, including RABC configuration and Kubernetes secret generation. Finally, start the BigDL PPML client container.</p>
                        <p><em>3. Run a user sample with BigDL PPML on ECS to test end-to-end security protection</em></p>
                        <p>Firstly, enter the BigDL PPML client container, generate appID, appKey and KMS key, and use the KMS key to encrypt the input data. Secondly, configure spark-executor-template. Yaml and place the encrypted data and KMS key in the NFS path. Finally, submit the task to the Kubernetes cluster and run the sample program.</p>
                        <p>Through the above attestation process, run industry benchmark TPC-DS based queries on Alibaba Cloud ECS g7t.32xlarge instances. The test configurations are as follows:</p>
                        <p>Taking the geometric mean of the time spent by 99 query statements as the metric, the running time of BigDL PPML based on Intel SGX is 1.89 times that of the case without Intel SGX protection.<sup>1</sup></p>
                        <p>Test data shows although there will be certain performance loss after Intel SGX is enabled, such performance loss is within an acceptable range. Moreover, the performance loss brought by Intel SGX is usually significantly lower than that of traditional security solutions, allowing it to save computing resources while protecting data security.</p>
