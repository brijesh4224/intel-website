                                The holistic practice of confidential computing, which encompasses data protection,
                                encryption, and network security features, allows businesses to discover the
                                transformative value of the cloud.
                            </p>

                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">What Is Cloud Security?</h2>
                            <p>Secure cloud computing encompasses three core capabilities: confidentiality, integrity,
                                and availability. Confidentiality is the ability to keep information secret from people
                                who shouldn’t have access. Integrity means that systems operate as they are intended to
                                function and produce outputs that are not unexpected or misleading. Availability speaks
                                to maintaining service uptime for cloud infrastructure and cloud-based services, which
                                includes preventing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.</p>
                            <p>Security is only as strong as the layer below it. Businesses that are crafting their
                                cloud security policies need to consider a “defense in depth” strategy. This means
                                building from the ground up with a trusted foundation in the hardware layer.
                                Applications and software in the cloud will run more securely when they are deployed on
                                a secure foundation.</p>
                            <p>There are numerous Intel® hardware-enabled tools that address these core capabilities in
                                cloud platforms, and with security features built into every piece of Intel® silicon—all
                                you have to do is enable them. Tools such as encryption, firmware, and platform
                                protections serve as a good starting point to help address the IT security concerns of
                                businesses and government agencies. With improved data security features available in
                                the cloud, you can finally realize the cost and agility benefits that come with public
                                cloud, private cloud, or hybrid cloud deployments through technologies that help enable
                                <a href="">confidential computing.</a></p>

                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Why Is Cloud Security Important?</h2>
                            <p>The cloud offers on-demand compute and storage resources that can help transform
                                businesses and accelerate services development and deployment. However, businesses can’t
                                enjoy all these potential benefits without a strong backbone to help protect them from
                                digital threats, malware, and hackers. The goal is to reduce total attack surface,
                                manage risks to accessing cloud resources, and ultimately make it profitable and
                                beneficial to use the cloud.</p>
                            <p>Every industry is working diligently to keep up with the ever-changing threat landscape,
                                whether it’s protecting intellectual property, keeping systems patched, or ensuring
                                compliance with privacy regulations. IT security teams are often short-staffed or
                                struggling to meet the constantly changing needs of the business. Cloud computing offers
                                a solution to these challenges because many public clouds have cybersecurity,
                                encryption, and data protection baked into their service offerings.</p>
                            <p>The cloud is emerging as a premier platform for the security conscious, where the latest
                                technologies are implemented, cybersecurity experts are available around the clock, and
                                advancements in digital threats are addressed in real time. Not only can businesses
                                benefit from on-demand compute and storage resources in the cloud, but they can also
                                benefit from world-class data security features as well.</p>

                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">How Is Cloud Security Different from Network Security?</h2>
                            <p>Network security refers to securing the perimeter of a data center, and the movement of
                                data inside or outside the data center. This entails using network infrastructure and
                                access controls to manage data flow and prevent digital threats from entering the
                                network. A key example of network security is the use of firewalls to restrict access to
                                specific network ports. But networking is just one piece of the equation and cloud
                                computing encompasses the full gamut of devices, data, and software. Businesses and
                                cloud architects need a robust and secure network perimeter, but there will always be
                                insider threats and data breaches that bypass perimeter protections. For this reason,
                                it’s important to have a multilayered security strategy, like confidential computing,
                                that touches hardware, software, and applications.</p>
                            <p></p>

                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Cloud for Regulated Industries</h2>
                            <p>While it’s important to protect cloud resources, it’s an even higher priority in
                                regulated industries such as healthcare, finance, and government. For example,
                                healthcare organizations in the United States must abide by the Health Insurance
                                Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to protect sensitive patient data from
                                unauthorized access. Financial services providers need to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley
                                Act for public accountability while employing their own cybersecurity methods to help
                                detect and prevent fraud.</p>
                            <p>Government offices must meet a strict set of compliance standards for <a
                                    href="">government cloud computing</a>. These include the Federal Risk and
                                Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) and the National Institute of Standards and
                                Technology (NIST) framework. Intel participated in the development of the NIST framework
                                and continues to help organizations align with its requirements.</p>
                            <p>Having a hardware-enabled root of trust can help provide assurance to both businesses in
                                these regulated industries and regulators themselves that due diligence is being
                                followed to help protect sensitive data in the cloud.</p>
                            <p><b>Data Sovereignty</b></p>
                        </section>
                        <section id="d_abc4">
                            <p><a href="">Data sovereignty</a> is another highly regulated area of consideration for
                                organizations using public cloud or hybrid cloud resources. The concept of data
                                sovereignty speaks to how national governments impose different requirements,
                                restrictions, or means of access to data based on where it is physically stored.
                                Regulations might stipulate that workloads or data about a nation’s citizens cannot
                                leave the country or rest on a server that isn’t within that nation’s borders.
                                Hardware-enabled features like trusted boot can help support data sovereignty. On
                                application start-up, trusted boot can help verify that data is exactly where it is
                                supposed to be, or else prevent an application from running with migrated data.</p>

                            <p>The confidential computing initiative helps enable an emerging use case in
                                cross-organizational collaboration known as multiparty computing. For example, the
                                University of California San Francisco (UCSF) created a <a href="">platform enabled by
                                    Intel® SGX</a> to ensure patient confidentiality while using algorithms to engage
                                curated data sets. This allows different hospitals to combine their data and accelerate
                                research, which could lead to early disease detection or fast-tracking drug trials. The
                                <a href="">Confidential Computing Consortium</a> is a community initiative that
                                continues to explore possibilities like multiparty computing, made possible by
                                innovations like Intel® SGX.</p>

                            <p>Intel works closely with cloud service providers (CSPs) to deliver the latest Intel®
                                hardware and technologies to help defend against threats. This includes the
                                implementation of new hardware generations with innovations like Intel® SGX and updates
                                to firmware or threat databases to help ensure that platforms are operating with the
                                most-up-to-date security patches. Using a public cloud allows businesses to benefit from
                                cutting-edge technology while offloading the management burden to research and implement
                                the newest technologies onto the CSPs. Regardless, businesses that are looking to design
                                and deploy their own private cloud infrastructure, or work with CSPs to access public
                                cloud resources, can start by seeking guidance from Intel.</p>
