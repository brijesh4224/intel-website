                            intrusion detection, web security gateways, and cloud access security brokers, changes in
                            workplace dynamics and the fast-advancing footprint of cybercrime call for additional
                            endpoint security to be applied to small business environments as well. This
                            “defense-in-depth” level of security is especially important to have today considering the
                            impacts of the recent pandemic and global shift to a more distributed workforce. <a

                            that corporate leaders today expect most employees to continue working remotely for at least
                            a few days per week, long after the pandemic ends. The “new normal” will be a hybrid style
                            of work, with some days—and/or employees—on-premises and some remote, according to 82
                            percent of company leaders surveyed by Gartner in 2020.<sup>6</sup></p>
                        <h2 class="k_26px mt-5 fw-lighter pt-4">Digital Transformation of the Office</h2>
                        <p>Work-from-home scenarios come with security challenges as remote employees are doing business
                            via their own personal networks. Depending on when security standards were set for a
                            company, it may be time to reexamine whether those security standards need to be updated to
                            accommodate recent changes in the computing environment.</p>
                        <p>Protecting your small business network in this hybrid work environment requires a zero trust
                            policy. Zero trust is the industry standard for an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms
                            that move defenses from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and
                            resources. Zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts
                            based solely on their physical or network location (e.g., local area networks vs. the
                            internet) or based on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned).</p>
                        <p>Using a zero trust policy, users are reauthenticated every time they access internal
                            resources, such as cloud SaaS or enterprise apps. Employee devices are also reauthenticated,
                            and device health is validated. Ultimately, when security capabilities are strengthened at
                            endpoints, where devices are deployed at the edge of the network, the risks to network
                            security are greatly reduced.</p>

                        <h2 class="k_26px mt-5 fw-lighter pt-4">Implementing Endpoint Security</h2>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">How can a small business best secure endpoints? The good news is that security ecosystem
                            providers are already bundling solutions that identify endpoint vulnerabilities such as
                            active threats, security violations, and device patches that need updating. <a

                        <p>Cloud applications are also aiding in small business network security with policies that

                        <p>While password-based logins continue to be widely used today, other, newer technologies are

                                security</a>&nbsp;capabilities go beyond the realm of protecting login credentials and
                            are vitally important to securing endpoints. Consider that malware continues to advance
                            technologically and is getting better at concealing itself across the network. In fact, even
                            though software-based security solutions offer protection for endpoints via signature-based
                            detection, malware today can rewrite itself once inside a system to evade these solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>The most sophisticated endpoint detection response (EDR) software solutions adopt a
                            multiprong approach to threat detection, including signature-based detections, file-based
                            behavior monitoring, and analysis-based techniques. These security tools are designed to
                            catch common threats, such as ransomware and cryptojacking, in which malicious actors use
                            someone else’s computer to mine cryptocurrency. While they offer some level of
                            effectiveness, malicious code is learning very quickly how to circumvent file-based
                            techniques, and it can be very difficult to uncover and contain a breach once a system is
                            infected.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Because <a

                            visibility into the health of devices and are much harder for malicious attacks to evade.
                            They also add a completely new threat signal from the CPU microarchitecture itself.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Ultimately, hardware security technology is there to augment EDR software in helping to
                            protect endpoints by identifying threats that are not visible to EDR tools. For example, CPU
                            threat detection featured in <a
                                href="#">Intel®

                            catches many zero-day threat derivatives and malware cloaking techniques. This
                            hardware-based sensor works along with EDR software to help identify threats and catch
                            malicious code that has evaded an EDR solution.</p>
                        <p>There are other layers of hardware-based endpoint security features that small businesses
                            should consider implementing today to secure their networks:</p>
