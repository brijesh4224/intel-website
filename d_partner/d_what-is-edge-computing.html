                            <p>Edge computing refers to processing, analyzing, and storing data closer to where it is
                                generated to enable rapid, near real-time analysis and response. In recent years, some
                                companies have consolidated operations by centralizing data storage and computing in the
                                cloud. But the demands of new use cases enabled by billions of distributed devices—from
                                advanced warehouse and inventory management solutions to vision-enhanced robotic
                                manufacturing lines to advanced smart cities traffic control systems—have made this
                                model
                                unsustainable.
                            </p>
                            <p>Additionally, the increased use of edge devices—from Internet of Things (IoT) devices,
                                such
                                as smart cameras, mobile point-of-sale kiosks, medical sensors, and industrial PCs to
                                gateways and computing infrastructure—for faster, near real-time actionable insights at

                                data source is driving exponential growth in the amount of data generated and collected.
                            </p>
                            <p>It’s estimated that by 2025, 75 percent of data will be created outside of central data
                                centers, where most processing takes place today.1 Taking this a step further,
                                approximately
                                90 percent of all data collected by enterprises today will never be used.2 Edge

                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Drivers of Edge Computing</h2>
                            <p>Cloud computing is being pushed to its limits by the needs of the services and
                                applications
                                it supports, from data storage and processing to system responsiveness. In many cases,
                                more
                                bandwidth or computing power isn’t enough to deliver on the requirements to process data
                                from connected devices more quickly and generate immediate insights and action in near
                                real-time. These gaps are driving the adoption and use of edge computing.
                            </p>
                            <p>Key contributing factors to challenges in the cloud include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Latency.</b>More industries are implementing applications that require rapid
                                    analysis
                                    and response. Cloud computing alone can’t keep up with these demands because of the
                                    latency introduced by network distance from the data source, resulting in
                                    inefficiency,
                                    lag time, and poor customer experiences.</li>
                                <li><b>Bandwidth.</b>Adding transmission bandwidth or more processing power could
                                    overcome
                                    latency issues. However, as companies continue to increase the number of edge
                                    devices on
                                    their network and the amount of data they generate, the cost to send data to the
                                    cloud
                                    may reach impractical levels that could be alleviated if data can be processed,
                                    stored,
                                    and analyzed at the edge.</li>
                                <li><b>Security and privacy.</b>Securing sensitive data, such as private medical
                                    records, at
                                    the edge and transmitting less data across the internet could help increase security
                                    by
                                    reducing the risk of interception. In addition, some governments or customers may
                                    require that data remain in the jurisdiction where it was created. In healthcare,
                                    for
                                    example, there may even be local or regional requirements to limit the storage or
                                    transmission of personal data.</li>
                                <li><b>Connectivity.</b>Lack of persistent internet connectivity can impede cloud
                                    computing,
                                    but a variety of network connectivity options make edge-to-cloud computing feasible.
                                    For
                                    example, 5G provides a high-bandwidth, low-latency connection for rapid data
                                    transfer
                                    and service delivery from the edge.</li>
                                <li><b>AI.</b>With the need for actionable intelligence in near real-time, companies
                                    need AI
                                    at the data source to allow faster processing and to take advantage of the potential
                                    in
                                    previously untapped data.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Benefits of Edge Computing</h2>
                            <p>Moving some data functions like storage, processing, and analysis away from the cloud and
                                to the edge and closer to where data is generated can offer several key benefits:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Increased speed and lower latency.</b>Moving data processing and analysis to the
                                    edge helps speed system response, enabling faster transactions and better
                                    experiences that could be vital in near real-time applications, like autonomous
                                    vehicle operation.</li>

                                    the network to the cloud can reduce the bandwidth and costs of transmitting and
                                    storing large volumes of data.</li>

                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">From the Edge to the Cloud</h2>
                            <p>Although edge computing provides an unprecedented opportunity for organizations to unlock
                                the value in data, the cloud remains essential as a central data repository and
                                processing center. The image below shows how edge devices for gathering data, computing,
                                storage, and networking combine to help organizations make the most of data at each
                                point.</p>
                            <p>IoT and edge computing devices collect data and manage it in one of two main ways.
                                Intelligent edge computing devices with built-in processors may offer advanced
                                capabilities like analytics or AI onboard, while devices without processors send the
                                data they generate to a server deployed at the on-premises edge for storage and
                                analysis. An on-premises edge server can then process data from the edge computing
                                devices and return critical information needed for near real-time applications or send
                                only the relevant portions of the data to the cloud. Data from numerous edge computing
                                devices can be consolidated in the cloud for more extensive processing and analysis.</p>

                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Edge Computing Use Cases</h2>
                            <p>Intel has worked with many industry partners and end customers to deploy tens of
                                thousands of edge computing solutions. Below are four edge computing use cases that show
                                how Intel has helped companies enable new experiences and drive more-efficient
                                operations.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Retail:</b>Edge computing can use sensors and cameras to improve retail inventory
                                    accuracy and help make supply chains and product development more efficient. In
                                    addition, edge computing can support analysis of customer behavior in near real-time
                                    for an enhanced and potentially safer shopping experience. For instance, the <a
                                        href="">Sensormatic</a> video-based AI solution helped retailers open stores
                                    safely during the COVID-19 pandemic by tracking occupancy and monitoring social
                                    distancing.</li>
                                <li><b>Industrial:</b>Edge computing can offer a foundation for Industry 4.0 by
                                    integrating digital and physical technologies for more-flexible and responsive
                                    manufacturing. For example, Intel and Nebbiolo Technologies worked with <a
                                        href="">Audi</a> auto manufacturing engineers to create a scalable, flexible
                                    platform that uses predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms to boost
                                    weld inspections and enhance critical quality-control processes.</li>
                                <li><b>Education:</b>Some software-based education solutions use on-device AI for
                                    personalized virtual assistance, natural language interaction, and even augmented
                                    reality experiences. For instance, the <a href="">ViewSonic digital whiteboard</a>
                                    experience uses edge and vision technology to re-create the classroom experience for
                                    students and teachers engaged in distance learning.</li>
                                <li><b>Healthcare:</b> Edge computing can help transform outcomes with inpatient and
                                    outpatient monitoring and telehealth services and use machine and deep learning
                                    inference on imaging equipment to help detect health issues faster. <a
                                        href="">Philips improved AI inference</a> for medical images by 188 percent on
                                    existing CT scan equipment with no need for expensive new hardware.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p></p>
