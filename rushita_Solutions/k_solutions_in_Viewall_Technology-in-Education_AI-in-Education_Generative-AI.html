                        <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5 pt-5" id="key3">How GenAI Works</h3>
                        <p>Implementing a generative AI solution for any use case requires significant efforts from data scientists and developers. That’s because GenAI is made possible by massive datasets and intricately trained AI algorithms. The technology is built on and deployed in conjunction with language AI and natural language processing (NLP), which allow artificial intelligence to process and understand human language. Together, GenAI and NLP can understand a user prompt to generate an appropriate response, whether text, video, imagery, or audio.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Generative AI solutions make use of AI systems called <a href="#">large language models (LLMs)</a>&nbsp;that employ deep neural networks to process and generate text. They’re trained on massive amounts of data, working to find commonalities between similar data types and information to create and deliver new, coherent outputs.</p>
                        <p>LLMs rely on transformer architectures to process input sequences in a parallel fashion, which improves performance and speed compared to traditional neural networks. Model training is also informed by the input of data scientists and subject matter experts who help guide the algorithm’s learning and shepherd it toward more-accurate outputs.</p>
                        <p>To enable GenAI solutions, businesses can either train GenAI models from scratch or select a pretrained model that can be fine-tuned to their specific needs. For example, a GenAI chatbot algorithm can be trained to the specific attributes of an organization’s customer base and business model. Or a model intended to generate text for content marketing can be further specialized or fine-tuned to focus on a specific industry and audience. More domain-specific models are also emerging at a rapid pace. These are trained on smaller, more targeted datasets than larger models. Emerging results indicate these smaller models can replicate the accuracy of larger ones if trained on carefully sourced data.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Developers may also use <a href="#">retrieval augmented generation (RAG)</a>&nbsp;to supplement pretrained models with up-to-date, proprietary, and confidential data from vector databases during inference. This simplifies customization and updating and enables attribution of generated information to its source.</p>
                        <p>Here’s a brief (though technically advanced) overview of three common types of GenAI models:<br>
                            &nbsp;</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Generative adversarial networks (GANs):</strong>&nbsp;These involve two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which are trained simultaneously. The generator creates new data instances, while the discriminator evaluates them against a set of real data. The generator’s goal is to produce data that is indistinguishable from real data, while the discriminator’s goal is to correctly distinguish between the two. Over time, the generator improves, creating increasingly realistic data.</li>
                                <li><strong>Variational autoencoders (VAEs): </strong>VAEs combine&nbsp;principles from neural networks and probabilistic modeling to generate new data instances through an encoding and decoding process. A VAE model starts by compressing input data into a simplified representation of its characteristics. Then it decodes that simplified version, attempting to reconstruct the input data to its original form. Through this process, the VAE learns the essential underlying features and parameters of the data, helping it to generate more-realistic and&nbsp;customizable outputs.</li>
                                <li><strong>Transformer models:</strong>&nbsp;Models like Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) can generate highly coherent and contextually relevant text. These models, originally designed for natural language processing tasks, are trained on large datasets and can complete text prompts, translate languages, answer questions, and even generate creative writing.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Various strategies can be used during the generation process to balance creativity and coherence in the outputs. Ongoing research aims to make these models more transparent, reduce biases, and improve factual accuracy. There has also been movement towards models that can simultaneously work with multiple types of data, such as text, images, and audio.</p>

                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5 pt-5" id="key4">How GenAI Is Used</h3>
                            <p>How businesses apply GenAI depends on the business challenge they seek to solve.</p>
                            <h3><strong>Text Generation</strong></h3>
                            <p>Perhaps the most common use of GenAI is text generation, in which the technology—supported by large neural networks—can understand and create human-like text. Text generation has been around for decades but has gained measurable momentum in the past several years. Popular uses include chatbots, marketing content, language translation services, summarization tools, customer support responses, and business reports. If a project requires any kind of writing, an organization may choose to explore text generation as part of the creative process.</p>
                            <h3><strong>Image, Video, Speech, and Music Generation</strong></h3>
                            <p>Using massive datasets of millions of existing images as a foundation, GenAI can learn patterns and then create new, original images based on criteria included in text prompts. Advertising, gaming, and product design companies use the technology to quickly explore and expand on creative concepts and accelerate prototyping processes.</p>
                            <p>Organizations are also using GenAI to create video and speech. Whether generating extra frames for an existing video, creating an entirely new scene, or manipulating or adding speech or audio, the potential time and cost savings of using GenAI to accomplish these tasks is appealing in many cases.</p>
                            <p>GenAI can make music as well by using neural networks trained on vast musical datasets to understand structure, style, and emotional content. Music is highly subjective, so whether listeners like the output is a matter of personal taste—much like it is for human-created music.</p>
                            <h3><strong>Code Generation</strong></h3>
                            <p>GenAI can enhance developer productivity by producing code, which it accomplishes by learning patterns from existing codebases and documentation. The technology can generate functions, classes, or entire programs based on natural language prompts or specifications. Many organizations use GenAI to accelerate software development, automate routine coding tasks, and assist in debugging—while simultaneously searching for the appropriate amount of human oversight to ensure quality, security, and alignment with project requirements.</p>
                            <h3><strong>Chatbots</strong></h3>
                            <p>Fast, efficient, and useful customer service is a nonnegotiable requirement for any organization. That’s why so many are implementing dynamic and intelligent conversational AI models that customers can interact with through text or speech. GenAI powers chatbots by understanding and generating human-like text responses. In addition to customer service, AI chatbots can supplement marketing efforts and support internal communications. They can also be integrated into websites, messaging apps, or voice assistants.</p>
                            <h3><strong>Data Augmentation</strong></h3>
                            <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Using GenAI, developers can create synthetic data to augment training datasets for <a href="#">machine learning</a>&nbsp;and deep learning models or help improve model performance and generalization. The technology can generate AI variations of images, text, or other data types, helping to expand limited datasets.</p>

                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5 pt-5" id="key4">Challenges of GenAI</h3>
                            <p>As with most nascent and continually evolving technologies, there are challenges to implementing and using generative AI. Principally, decision-makers should be aware of data security and privacy risks, computational resourcing and expense, and ethical and societal implications, including the chance of spreading misinformation.</p>
                            <h3><strong>Use Case-Specific Challenges</strong></h3>
                            <p>Each generative AI use case presents its own challenges:<br>
                                &nbsp;</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Text generation:</strong>&nbsp;Despite the incredible strides made seemingly every day, text generation is far from foolproof. It’s therefore crucial that actual human beings oversee the process, ensure the accuracy and appropriateness of the generated content, and, in many instances, provide original, thoughtful, and valuable ideas and language to a first draft created by GenAI technology.<br>
                                    Moreover, for both creative and legal reasons, organizations should implement guidelines for the responsible use of text generation, addressing potential biases and verifying AI-generated content before publishing it.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Image, video, speech, and music generation:</strong>&nbsp;As with text generation, there are risks and potential concerns when using GenAI to create images, particularly surrounding creativity, authenticity, and intellectual property rights. Talented human designers are required not only to effectively prompt GenAI tools but also to review, refine, and customize the images produced by the technology.<br>
                                    Potential challenges with GenAI video and speech include significant ethical risks, from inadvertent misrepresentation to deepfakes. Accordingly, GenAI video and speech should be used responsibly, preferably by professionals adhering to formal brand guidelines and organizational oversight.<br>
                                    When using GenAI to create music, organizations should note that musicians have been writing, performing, and sharing songs, sounds, and beats for thousands of years, and they arguably bring uniquely human advantages to the process and the results.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Chatbots:</strong>&nbsp;Because GenAI chatbots can handle routine inquiries 24/7, they help free up human beings to handle more-complex issues. But as with other GenAI implementations, there are limits to what the technology can accomplish. Organizations should ensure that human support is available when needed. Furthermore, effective implementation requires continuous monitoring and refinement based on user interactions and feedback.</li>
