                        <p>Stony Brook University recently upgraded its Seawulf supercomputer, a heterogeneous system
                            comprising CPUs and GPUs, delivering up to 1.86 petaFLOPS. The most recent addition was
                            built on Intel® Xeon® CPU Max Series with High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM). Stony Brook
                            researchers and computational scientists have experience with HBM through the university’s
                            Ookami cluster, built on the Fujitsu A64FX processor with HBM. </p>
                        <p>The Intel® Xeon® CPU Max Series with HBM accelerates execution of memory bandwidth bound
                            applications, while the new Intel Xeon processor architecture increases overall performance
                            compared to previous generations of Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors.</p>
                        <p>Stony Brook researchers benchmarked the new Seawulf partition, which are presented below.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Challenge</h2>
                        <p><a href="">Stony Brook University</a>’s <a href="">Seawulf cluster</a> is a heterogeneous
                            platform that has greatly evolved
                            over the last 10 years. Seawulf is a mix of multi-generational x86 CPUs and GPUs
                            interconnected by multi-generational InfiniBand fabrics and a GPFS storage array with both
                            spinning disks and SSDs.</p>

                        <i>Stony Brook’s Institute for Advanced Computational Science chose Intel® Xeon® CPU Max Series
                            with High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) for their recent addition to their Seawulf cluster.</i>
                        <p>Stony Brook is unique among universities, in that it is one of a very few institutions1 that
                            also runs a Fugaku-like supercomputer—named Ookami—built on the Fujitsu A64FX CPU with
                            high-bandwidth memory (HBM). Fugaku, at the Riken Center For Computational Science in Japan,
                            has ranked in the top four of the Top500.org’s list for the last four years. It held first
                            place in 2020 and 2021. Its performance benefited from HBM technology. Students of <a
                                href="">Stony Brook’s Institute for Advanced Computational Science (IACS)</a> have been
                            learning from
                            Ookami,
                            running a variety of scientific workloads since its deployment.</p>
                        <p>To continue to provide researchers and students of the IACS with advanced computing
                            resources—including for machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)—the IACS and
                            Information Technology departments needed to expand the cluster. In late 2022, having
                            learned much from Ookami while also building on its experience with x86 architecture, the
                            university began its search for the technology that would power Seawulf’s new partition—HBM
                            would be an important part of it.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Solution</h2>
                        <p>Stony Brook researchers run a variety of scientific simulations on their clusters (both
                            Seawulf and Ookami), including astrophysics, ocean modeling, molecular dynamics, and others.
                            Some of these are memory bandwidth bound.</p>
                        <p>“The limited memory bandwidth of mainstream processor technology meant it was very hard to
                            get good thread scaling and utilize all the cores on modern systems,” said Robert Harrison,
                            Director of the IACS at Stony Brook. “Our very positive experiences on the National Science
                            Foundation-sponsored Ookami cluster led us to look at the Intel Xeon CPU Max Series and
                            believe it could deliver on performance with HBM.”</p>
                        <p>Robert and his team engaged with Intel early in the system architecture design and selection
                            process for information needed to determine that the <a href="">Intel® Xeon® CPU Max
                                Series</a> was the
                            technology and architecture to move forward with. After a typical tender, in 2023, Stony
                            Brook chose HPE to expand Seawulf.</p>
                        <p>In addition to leveraging technologies from HPE and Intel, the new HPC and AI solution was
                            deployed by ComnetCo, HPE’s HPC-focused solution provider and award-winning public sector
                            partner.</p>
                        <p>The new partition comprises 94 HPE ProLiant DL360 Gen11 compute nodes, each with two Intel®
                            Xeon® Max 9468 processors (48 cores each/9,024 cores total), 256 GB of DDR5 memory, 128 GB
                            of HBM, and an InfiniBand NDR (400 Gbps) fabric. The new partition added 0.78 petaFLOPS to
                            the cluster, bringing it to its 1.86 petaFLOPS rating.2</p>
                        <p> The system became production-ready in November 2023, after several benchmarks and
                            application
                            performance tests were completed. The testing showed significant performance improvements
                            provided by the Intel Xeon CPU Max series with HBM (described below).</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Result</h2>
                        <p>A group of researchers and computational scientists with the IACS ran a battery of benchmarks
                            to evaluate the performance impact from HBM. They also ran deep learning problems and
                            real-world applications to see how they might benefit from HBM and the new CPU architecture.
                            Scientific applications included Gromacs molecular dynamics and OpenFOAM computational fluid
                            dynamics. The study was documented in a reviewed research paper.3</p>
                        <p>Additionally, the new Seawulf cluster has been the target for running astrophysics and ocean
                            modeling workloads by Stony Brook researchers.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Testing Platforms</h2>
                        <p>The testing compared the Intel Xeon CPU Max Series nodes against Seawulf nodes built on
                            Intel® Xeon® Gold 6184 processor and AMD EPYC 7643 CPU (codenamed Milan), and on Ookami’s
                            Fujitsu A64FX-FX700 processor.3 The testing included all these processors where appropriate;
                            some processors do not support operations and capabilities of the Intel Xeon CPU Max Series,
                            so those processors were not included in certain tests.</p>
                        <p>For details about the testing platforms, protocol, benchmarks, and applications, see the
                            paper.3 The following charts and summary performance results reference that study.
                            Additionally, the study looked at other factors beyond performance, including performance
                            per core and power consumption (not included here).</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Benchmarks</h2>
                        <p>Benchmark results are shown in Figure 1 (for HBM) and Figure 2 (for DDR). The chart shows the
                            speedup performance improvement of Intel Xeon Max 9468 processor compared to other CPUs for
                            each of the benchmarks. Memory bandwidth tests included sustained bandwidth (STREAM TRIAD)
                            and scaling and thread distribution (results not shown). The scaling and distribution
                            benchmark examined memory bandwidth across threads as operations were scaled to more
                            threads.</p>

                        <p>Sustained memory bandwidth was 3.5X higher with HBM versus just DDR on the new Intel Xeon CPU
                            Max Series. According to the study, the memory copy benchmark revealed HBM improves memory
                            bandwidth utilization nearly linearly up to full subscription on a node, while with DDR
                            only, bandwidth saturates quickly.</p>
                        <p>It’s worth noting that, while all benchmarks show improvement with HBM versus DDR on the new
                            Intel CPU, the degree of benefit varies across tests. This is expected, since some codes are
                            not memory bandwidth bound, as was also seen in application testing.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">oneDNN Benchmark</h2>
                        <p>For deep learning training and inference applications, functions of the Intel® oneAPI oneDNN
                            library were evaluated.</p>
                        <p>“While other benchmarks looked at the memory bandwidth, the oneDNN benchmark was of
                            particular interest to me,” commented Smeet Chheda, a PhD candidate in the IACS, “because of
                            the tile multiplication unit, which was new on the system. It is helpful in accelerating
                            deep learning applications. I benchmarked the convolution operator because it’s an expensive
                            and widely used operation. And it has matrix multiplication as well.”</p>
                        <p>Different inputs with different configurations were tested, including different data types.
                            Data types included fp32, BF16, and INT8, which are types used in various training and
                            inference use cases. For fp32 data types, Intel Xeon CPU Max Series with HBM ran up to 1.7
                            to 3.5 times faster than the previous version Intel® processor and the A64FX CPU,
                            respectively. For BF16 data types, Intel Xeon CPU Max Series with HBM was 1.79 to 9.2 times
                            faster than the fp32 benchmarks. For INT8 data types, the new Intel processor delivered from
                            16.1X to 17.5X speedup over the previous version Intel processor and A64FX CPU,
                            respectively.</p>
                        <p>“Generally, for the Intel Xeon CPU Max series, I saw a 2X benefit with HBM versus DDR on the
                            new CPU,” concluded Chheda.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Gromacs</h2>
                        <p>For Gromacs, several sized problems were run. The results show that HBM does not
                            significantly benefit performance versus DDR on the new Intel processor. However, it does
                            significantly outperform other CPUs, both when using HBM (Figure 3) and DDR (Figure 4).</p>

                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Exploding Stars</h2>
                        <p>PhD candidates Catherine Feldman and Josh Martin are working on optimizing the astrophysics
                            suite called Flash to run it on the new Seawulf partition. Flash is a Multiphysics code that
                            simulates the explosion of a star.</p>
                        <p>“We’re studying Type Ia supernovae, which is a stellar explosion that’s ten billion times
                            brighter than our sun,” explained Feldman. “Observational astronomers use the brightness of
                            these explosions to determine distances across the universe. The better we understand how
                            these explosions happen, the better we can calibrate our measuring tape, so to speak, and
                            make a better map of the universe. So, we use Flash to simulate an explosion and thereby
                            better understand how they happen.”</p>
                        <p>Flash has been around for 20 years, and Alan Calder, professor of astronomy and physics and
                            deputy director of the IACS, is a contributor to part of the code. Until now, with current
                            computing resources at Stony Brook, researchers have been limited to 2D simulations of these
                            explosions. But Calder expects with the new partition of Seawulf, they will be able to
                            perform 3D simulations of explosions.</p>
                        <p>Feldman and Martin have been working with the code to run different sized 2D and 3D
                            simulations on the Intel Xeon CPU Max Series. Their testing is currently ongoing and will be
                            revealed in an upcoming paper.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Solution Summary</h2>
                        <p>Stony Brook University’s Seawulf cluster was due for an upgrade. With experience from their
                            Fugaku-like Ookami cluster, they understood the benefits of HBM for memory bandwidth-bound
                            workloads. Thus, they looked at the new Intel Xeon CPU Max Series as the foundation for a
                            new set of nodes on Seawulf.</p>
                        <p>HPE built the new partition with 94 nodes of HPE ProLiant DL360 Gen11 servers, each hosting
                            two Intel Xeon Max 9468 processors with HBM. The system was put into production in 2023, and
                            several researchers and computational scientists have been running it through its paces,
                            resulting in one published research paper on performance of the new system compared to other
                            IACS computational resources and another on the way revealing results of the astrophysics
                            code, Flash, on the new system.</p>
                        <p>Overall, the new partition delivers as much as 3.5X sustained memory bandwidth and better
                            thread scaling running with HBM versus DDR. With its new tile multiplication unit, the new
                            Intel CPU delivers better performance on deep learning with oneDNN across multiple data
                            types used in training and inference. And, while all workloads do not benefit from
                            HBM—irrespective of the computing resource it runs on—the new nodes with Intel Xeon Max 9368
                            processor outperforms the other CPUs on nearly all workloads tested.</p>
