                        </h2>
                        <p>In a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, someone attempts to bring down a web
                            service by overwhelming it with traffic. Cloud service providers, such as Gcore, must build
                            defenses to protect their clients.</p>
                        <p>Gcore originally used software appliances based on the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) to
                            filter out illegitimate traffic. The solution used industry-standard servers, but those
                            servers could not be used for other software at the same time.</p>
                        <p>The software appliances had significant limitations. “All the traffic for customers had to
                            pass through the protection system,” said Ivan Koveshnikov, Lead Software Engineer at Gcore.
                            “We had to build our network to the design set out by the DDoS protection creators, and we
                            had to maintain a lot of connections to achieve high performance.”</p>
                        <p>Gcore had seen the ferocity of attacks increase significantly. “Two years ago, we suffered
                            from 300 to 400 Gbps attacks,” said Andrew Slastenov, Product Manager, Security, Gcore.
                            “Now, we’re seeing attacks of 700 Gbps and the biggest attack we’ve seen was 1.4 TB per
                            second. To keep up with the increasing power of DDoS attacks, we need to at least double our
                            DDoS protection each year. The software license for our DDoS solution costs a lot, and it’s
                            not sustainable to double our license fees each year.”</p>
                        <p>One of Gcore’s customers is Wargaming, a company that provides immersive, graphically rich
                            combat simulators including World of Tanks, World of Warships, and World of Warplanes.
                            Wargaming relies on Gcore’s content delivery network of 1,000 servers worldwide to provide a
                            fast and responsive service to players.</p>
                        <p>“We constantly face the threat of DDoS attacks,” said Dmitry Kuryanovich, Head of
                            Maintenance, Wargaming. “Part of the puzzle is that vendors do not all have the same quality
                            of protection around the globe. Some have good coverage in the US and Europe, but not a
                            strong presence in the Middle East. In the US, our previous vendor had a significant lag
                            because we were hosted a long way from their data center. That affected the user experience
                            even if we survived the attack. The ping time is important for gaming companies, especially
                            during battles.”</p>
                        <p>In 2020, Wargaming experienced a sustained attack of 200 Gbps to 440 Gbps over a period of a
                            month. “It was a planned and well-designed attack against us,” said Kuryanovich. “It
                            resulted in downtime several times, which is frustrating for our customers. We had to
                            increase our protection in stages. First, we had to protect the service so it would not go
                            down. Then, we had to ensure we were not dropping any players. Finally, we achieved full
                            protection.”</p>
                        <p>Wargaming’s gaming traffic is particularly hard to filter because it is encrypted and uses
                            the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). “The attacks mimicked our gaming traffic,” said
                            Kuryanovich. “There’s no easy way to understand what is legitimate traffic and what is
                            fake.”</p>

                                SYN flood attack works by sending many SYN packets but not sending the ACK packets to
                                establish the connections. This results in half-open connections that consume server
                                resources.</i></p>
                        <p>As well as the attacks on its gaming servers, Wargaming needed protection for the servers
                            that host its websites. These servers use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). One
                            common type of attack is a TCP SYN flood attack, in which the attacking server initiates a
                            series of connections to the server under attack but does not acknowledge the response (see
                            Figure 1). This results in the server under attack allocating resources to half-open
                            connections. When there are enough of these half-open connections, they consume so many
                            resources that the server cannot connect to legitimate clients.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;" class="fw-lighter">Solution Details
                        </h2>
                        <p>Gcore decided to build its own DDoS filtering solution, which could be hosted on the 1,000
                            nodes of its content delivery network (CDN). Instead of dedicating powerful servers to DDoS
                            filtering, the idea was to use a small proportion of the resources on all its existing CDN
                            servers. The CDN network can provide protection around the world.</p>
                        <p>An in-house solution can be scaled more effectively in the future, and without escalating
                            license fees, as the intensity of attacks grows.</p>
                        <p>The project took a phased approach:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Replace the third-party DDoS software on the dedicated DDoS protection servers with
                                Gcore’s own software.
                            </li>
                            <li>2Move the software from dedicated servers to CDN nodes.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Gcore worked closely with Wargaming to build a UDP filtering solution. It used software
                            hosted on both Wargaming’s servers and Gcore’s servers, so that it could differentiate
                            between spoofed and legitimate gaming traffic. Gcore also developed its own software to
                            mitigate against TCP SYN flood attacks.</p>
                        <p>Express Data Path (XDP) was used to enable fast packet filtering, because it could be
                            integrated easily with the CDN nodes.</p>
                        <p>The change in DDoS software has given Gcore an opportunity to upgrade the processor it was
                            using, from 2nd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors to 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable
                            processors. “We benefit a lot from having more cores on the processors than we had on the
                            previous processors,” said Koveshnikov.</p>
                        <p>The solution also uses 100GbE Intel® Ethernet 800 Series Network Adapters. These cards have
                            capabilities to optimize high-performance server workloads and cater for bandwidth-intensive
                            workloads.</p>
                        <p>To increase the filtering capacity per appliance further, Gcore is researching the potential
                            to use the latest generation 200GbE network interface cards and <a href="">Intel® Field

                            Expertise</h2>
                        <p>Intel has collaborated closely with Gcore, sharing insights on its technology, XDP and
                            performance optimization. “We have monthly calls with the Intel developers who are working
                            on the hardware,” said Koveshnikov. “The team has been supportive analyzing our sometimes
                            complicated situations. They’ve given us many ideas about how we can optimize our
                            workflows.”</p>
                        <p>He adds: “We told Intel about a problem that we discovered during testing. Intel replicated
                            our tests, found the bug, and fixed it in the main software distribution.”</p>
                        <p>“When you adopt a new technology, it’s always a challenge,” he said. “We’re creating
                            high-performance traffic filtering solutions, and a generic approach can’t make a fast
                            enough solution. It’s hard to find people who have experience with this, but we found them
                            at Intel. As a contributor to XDP, Intel was able to share their insights with us about
                            upcoming features for the Linux kernel.”</p>
                        <p>Gcore is using Intel® Hyperscan, a high-performance library for matching regular expressions
                            (regex), which are search patterns. Hyperscan enables large numbers of regular expressions
                            to be matched across streams of data. “We use Hyperscan to match packet data using regular
                            expressions, and drop or pass traffic accordingly,” said Slastenov. “Hyperscan is a powerful
                            tool that is ideal for traffic filtering at the application layer. It delivers great
                            performance and enables us to match a lot of data simultaneously.”</p>

                        <p>Gcore has conducted testing on its new software, running on dedicated DDoS protection
                            servers. The company plans to integrate the software with the CDN over the coming months, in
                            time for the peak season of DDoS attacks, which runs from September to February. Using the
                            new software on the latest 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors has increased the
                            filtering capacity from 100 Gbps to up to 400 Gbps per alliance1.</p>
                        <p>Gcore ran a series of TCP SYN flood tests on its minimum viable product (MVP) DDoS software.
                            The tests used realistic traffic generated by Cisco TRex traffic generator. Although Gcore
                            will be deploying on 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Gold processors, the tests were conducted using 2nd
                            Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors, which were in the existing DDoS servers.
                        </p>
                        <p>The tests included the following test cases:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Traffic drop test. In this test, a packet is examined, evaluated against coarse rules,
                                and dropped before the server acknowledges the connection request.</li>
                            <li>SYN cookie challenge test. To mitigate against TCP SYN flood attacks, the server can
                                send a targeted cookie and demand a response to that cookie before it allocates server
                                resources.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The tests measured the processing capacity in megapackets per second (Mpps) and in gigabits
                            per second (Gbps). “Most of our customers suffer from the bandwidth of the attack (Gbps) not
                            from the number of packets (Mpps),” said Koveshnikov. “However, when we filter the traffic,
                            we only look at the headers, so it’s the number of packets that matters most when it comes
                            to the filtering capacity.”</p>
                        <p>The in-house solution was as performant as the commercial solution, and in some respects
                            achieved higher performance. As Table 1 shows, the traffic drop test had a maximum
                            throughput of 108 Mpps and 51.9 Gbps2. The SYN cookie challenge test achieved 62 Mpps and
                            31.6 Gbps2. The tests also showed the CPU load of the solution was up to 56%, leaving enough
                            capacity for the CDN application2.</p>
                        <p>“Our tests showed that there are no hardware bottlenecks and the raw power of the Intel Xeon
                            Gold processor can filter this traffic,” said Slastenov.</p>

                        <p>Gcore also worked with Wargaming to test the DDoS protection for UDP gaming traffic. The test
                            worked by
                            increasing the garbage traffic rate until it resulted in packet drops of legitimate traffic.
                            Table 2 shows the test results, based on the packet size of the garbage traffic. The
                            Filtered column shows how many packets can be filtered until there is an impact on
                            legitimate traffic. The Line rate column shows how many packets the network can accommodate.
                            The last column shows how many packets can be filtered as a percentage of the whole network
                            channel.</p>
                        <p>The tests show that attacks with packet sizes of 256 bytes or larger can be filtered at close
                            to line rate speed. “This is an impressive result,” said Koveshnikov, “because now a single
                            server can mitigate a 400 Gbps attack. Most attacks use a bigger packet size, where we can
                            see the filtering solution works effectively with a low CPU usage.”</p>
