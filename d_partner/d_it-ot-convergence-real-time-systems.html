                                To support Industry 4.0, industrial organizations are looking to converge operational
                                technology (OT) and information technology (IT) onto a single platform. But to do so,
                                they need high compute performance hardware with technology features that deliver the
                                stringent real-time performance required on the plant floor. Read on to learn how Intel
                                makes workload consolidation and real-time computing possible.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <h4 class="d_head bold"><b>IT/OT Convergence Demands Real-Time Performance</b></h4>
                            <p>As part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution—also known as Industry 4.0—organizations want
                                to enhance existing computing and automation in operational technology (OT) with smart
                                and autonomous systems that leverage modern IT approaches, including data-driven machine
                                learning. There is also a continual trend to integrate manufacturing functions with IT
                                infrastructure for a connected factory. To achieve this goal, they’re pursuing IT/OT
                                convergence, where OT systems and applications run on IT hardware, often with multiple
                                OT devices consolidated onto a single node. Doing so, organizations can realize new
                                efficiencies on the plant floor while tearing down the traditional proprietary data
                                silos that hold back connected operations.</p>
                            <p>Since industrial automation and OT have evolved separately from traditional IT, it is
                                important when consolidating OT and IT onto a single hardware platform to have temporal
                                isolation between IT and OT activities to ensure that all timing and performance
                                requirements are met in a system that is running both OT and IT processes.</p>
                            <p>Traditionally, OT systems have employed different hardware and software platforms with OT
                                relying more on a variety of controllers and sensors feeding real-time data across
                                proprietary networks and into vendor-specific systems. As a result, silos of information
                                have arisen, making it difficult for divergent systems to interoperate and often
                                preventing the move to more-flexible manufacturing environments required to achieve new
                                automation and production goals.</p>
                            <p>Disparate systems make it more difficult to incorporate IT administration and analysis
                                into OT tasks. Additionally, single-function OT systems, by definition, lack flexible,
                                software-defined infrastructure that could enable changing applications easily to meet
                                multiple needs.</p>
                            <p>By converging IT and OT, you can manage OT resources like IT systems—eliminating the OT
                                information siloes that impede management, upgrades, and monitoring. Bringing IT and OT
                                together makes it simple for equipment data to be collected, stored in the cloud, and
                                accessed from any network device for predictive maintenance, quality inspections, and
                                resource utilization monitoring.</p>
                            <p>However, the extremely stringent time demands of OT systems and equipment mean that IT
                                hardware and applications must be able to support <a href="">real-time computing</a> and
                                use cases that require hard real-time performance in converged IT/OT systems.</p>

                            <p>IT/OT convergence puts new strains on development teams who often struggle to ensure that
                                both OT and IT tasks perform well without negatively impacting each other’s performance.
                                Finding hotspots throughout the hardware, firmware, and software layers can present
                                difficult challenges. </p>
                            <p><a href="">Intel® Time Coordinated Computing Tools (Intel® TCC Tools)</a> is designed to
                                simplify creation and debugging of real-time systems and applications by providing
                                multiple optimization points, from out-of-the-box optimizations to BIOS options and
                                progressively sophisticated fine-tuning tools. </p>
                            <p>Intel® TCC Tools aids in IT/OT convergence by providing an easy interface to optimize the
                                timing of task processing between components within a system. This tuning helps minimize
                                the latency in each OT node to ensure applications fulfill the real-time performance
                                demanded by IT administrations. </p>
                            <p>Intel® TCC Tools provides value for developers by helping to determine where performance
                                leaks may be in the stack. By optimizing hardware, firmware, middleware, and up to the
                                application layer, Intel® TCC Tools can save effort that would have been expended to
                                hand-tune every level of the stack.</p>
                            <p>Intel® TCC Tools provides a set of real-time tuning features that ensure the system meets
                                real-time requirements. These features include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Power management tuning</b>that allows processors and I/O components to perform

                                    be further refined with Intel® TCC Tools to strike the desired balance between
                                    performance and power.</li>
                                <li><b>Intel® TCC mode,</b>a set of BIOS options that disables those features that

                                application, or data streams is needed. For many applications, the out-of-the box
                                defaults and presets for the Intel® TCC mode of the hardware can achieve real-time goals
                                without the need for highly specialized expertise or trial-and-error debugging.</p>

                                time-sensitive (real-time) applications. Intel® products support several key TSN
                                specifications, enabling open, interoperable, and real-time communication for industrial
                                automation functions. TSN is applicable to many markets, including the industrial
                                sector. Different sectors have different requirements for TSN specifications. Currently,
                                the industrial sector’s IEEE 60802 profile is leading in several areas, but it is
                                expected that other markets will eventually follow.</p>

                            <p>TSN provides the foundation for interoperability between industrial vendors in the same
                                way that Ethernet does in enterprise IT infrastructure. By using standard Ethernet
                                components, TSN can also integrate with existing brownfield applications. Intel® IoT
                                endpoint solutions support all the relevant TSN specifications. While some of the
                                specifications require actual support in the hardware and drivers, others are part of
                                the application level. Intel’s TSN technologies provide a real-time network foundation
                                for the evolution of smart, connected, and ultimately autonomous factories. Since TSN is
                                based on standard Ethernet, it also provides the platform for a single communication
                                fabric to enable IT and OT convergence.</p>

                            <h4 class="d_head bold"><b>Intel® Architecture: Performance Advantages</b></h4>
                            <p>Intel supports new solutions that deliver both high compute and real-time performance,
                                allowing for the consolidation of real-time and non-real-time workloads on a single
                                chip. As new workloads are added or the volume of OT data increases, more-powerful
                                compute elements can be used without the need to rearchitect each application. When
                                different applications and locations require different systems, the IT and OT
                                environment can remain the same.</p>
                            <p>Intel investments in software allow temporal portability, providing an easy migration
                                from Intel Atom® to Intel® Core™ to Intel® Xeon® processors and enabling the use of the
                                same software and tools across different systems. Converging IT and OT also lets
                                organizations do more with less by migrating workloads that previously ran on multiple
                                discrete devices onto a single, industry-standard system. Multiple real-time workloads
                                in temporal isolation from each other and from other non-real-time workloads on a single
                                Intel-powered system can meet stringent real-time performance demands, even when
                                multiple real-time applications are running concurrently on the same system. Integration
                                of multiple capabilities onto a single platform drives down costs and increases design
                                efficiency. </p>
                            <p>IT/OT convergence allows developers to break out of data siloes and proprietary
                                ecosystems that are challenged by emerging standards. The Intel® architecture stack is
                                open platform ready, with support for Industry 4.0 standards including OPC UA.</p>
                            <p>Moving OT workloads to Intel® architecture delivers savings in several ways:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Temporal portability</b>TCC and TSN are platform-agnostic real-time capabilities
                                    that scale between different platforms so systems can grow with minimal impact to
                                    code, helping to future-proof designs.</li>
                                <li><b>More flexibility:</b>Development teams can design, deploy, and upgrade via field
                                    updating to eliminate forklift upgrades and reduce the need for on-site visits.</li>
                                <li><b>Application agility:</b>Switching between applications becomes much easier with a
                                    software-defined infrastructure. A robot that moves goods from a warehouse to the
                                    shipping department during the day can take inventory during the evening. <a
                                        href="">See how this works in the real world.</a></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Managing OT using IT methodologies and platforms offers several quantifiable benefits to
                                developers and to the manufacturer, including:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Lower operational costs:</b>By optimizing their use of resources, factories may
                                    reduce installation, energy, cooling, and management costs for a range of functions.
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Lower capital costs:</b>Reduced infrastructure means fewer systems to procure and
                                    maintain. Factories that bring OT and IT together may be able to lower their capital
                                    expenses and avoid future purchases when new capabilities are added.</li>
                                <li><b>Space savings:</b>Consolidating many single-function devices into an integrated
                                    system can free up valuable floor space and optimize real estate.</li>
                                <li><b>Increased efficiency:</b>Multiple functions can be consolidated into one console
                                    for a faster, improved user experience, and remote management capabilities can
                                    streamline maintenance tasks by enabling anytime, anywhere access to operational
                                    information.</li>
                                <li><b>Reduced downtime:</b> By collecting real-time data from equipment, factory
                                    operators can predict maintenance issues and reduce unplanned downtime.</li>
                                <li><b>Increased scalability: </b>Compute, memory, and storage resources can be scaled
                                    quickly and with little downtime.</li>
                                <li><b>Improved security profile:</b>Converged IT/OT networks can be secured and
                                    monitored, with data collected across systems used to identify and mitigate
                                    potential threats.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Organization can use the <a href="">workload convergence estimator</a> to gauge the
                                business value of IT/OT convergence.</p>
