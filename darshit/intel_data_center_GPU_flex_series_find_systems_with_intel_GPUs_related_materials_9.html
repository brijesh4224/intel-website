                        <p><a class="b_special_a1" href="">SoftBank Corp.</a> develops various businesses centered on the mobile communications business, broadband services, and fixed-line telecommunications business based on the corporate philosophy “Information Revolution—Happiness for everyone.” The company, which has led the SoftBank Group’s communication business for many years, has been listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange in December 2018, and is currently taking the information revolution to a new stage under the Beyond Carrier Strategy, which goes beyond the traditional telecommunications business model, providing innovative services in a wide range of industries and aiming for further growth.</p>

                        <p>In the core communication business, SoftBank, Y!mobile, and LINE MOBILE, a multicarrier MVNO, are addressing diverse needs with these three brands. SoftBank and Y!mobile provide unique services in cooperation with Yahoo!, one of the largest portal sites in Japan. In addition, while developing fiber optical circuits for fixed-line and corporate services, we are promoting technology development and demonstration experiments for new service solutions using advanced technologies such as AI, IoT, robots, and automated driving toward the practical application of high-speed, large-capacity, low-latency in 5G.</p>

                        <p>The IT Infrastructure Division, IT Division, supports the company’s Beyond Carrier strategy, which is constantly innovating and taking on challenges. “Communication Services and their infrastructure have become indispensable in everyday life and business, and their importance is increasing more than ever,” said Tadashi Suzuki, Senior Director, IT Infrastructure Division, Information Technology Division. “The role of our IT Division is to pursue the latest technology while prioritizing the safety and stability of communications, and to make people happy by the information revolution.”</p>

                        <h3 style="font-weight: 350; margin: 2rem 0 11px;">Validating Features and Performance of Intel® Optane™ Persistent Memory to Improve Server Consolidation Rate</h3>
                        
                        <p>As a communications carrier, SoftBank uses more than 10,000 virtual machines for its internal IT infrastructure, mainly for mission-critical systems, information systems used by approximately 45,000 employees of the company and its partner companies, applications used in day-to-day operations such as call center systems, store systems or billing systems used in mobile shops, and consumer services such as smartphone applications/cloud services etc. Since the merger of SoftBank Mobile, SoftBank BB, SoftBank Telecom, and Y!mobile in 2015, the company has managed multiple distributed data centers and more than 1,000 racks.</p>
                        
                        <p>SoftBank has introduced a virtualization platform for more than 10 years to improve the efficiency of infrastructure, but the hardware has been aging and the number of operation steps in the event of a failure has been increasing year by year. As a result of the introduction of the virtualization platform at the right place for the business application, hypervisors of commercial products such as VMware, Hyper-V, Xen, KVM, and OpenStack of OSS, etc., were mixed in the platform.</p>

                        <p>With more than 1,000 virtual machines growing each year, the need for the rack space in the data center was also increasing. Therefore, in order to increase the server consolidation rate and reduce infrastructure costs, we built an integrated virtualization platform unified with VMware in 2018 and started consolidating systems running on the previous virtualization platform in June 2019.</p>

                        <p>However, when we checked the usage of virtualization infrastructure resources at the end of the migration of about 1,000 virtual machines, it was found that the memory allocation rate almost reached the limit (100%), even though the CPU utilization could be spared. Kohei Tanemura, Director, IT Infrastructure Department, IT Infrastructure Division, Information Technology Division, commented as follows.</p>

                        <p>“Because of the peak in communication access, we are investing in platform based on busy season capacity. Although the CPU usage fluctuates, the memory initially allocated is fixed and reserved, may suffer from been run out first. Also, compared to CPUs that can allocate more virtual resources than physical resources with overcommitment, the overcommitment of memory is not recommended, and memory resources will be exhausted first when trying to increase the consolidation rate.”</p>

                        <p>To address these issues, SoftBank focused on <a class="b_special_a1" href="">Intel Optane persistent memory,</a>  a non-volatile memory that offers both high access performance and large capacity. As soon as it was released from Intel in April 2019, the company adopted it immediately, and it was decided to determine whether or not it could be introduced into the integrated virtualization platform, and to verify its operation and usefulness. “The purpose is to study the server design that will be introduced in the future and to verify whether it can contribute to an increase in the server consolidation rate,” recalls Yusuke Omiya, Manager, also from IT Infrastructure Department.</p>

                        <h3 style="font-weight: 350; margin: 2rem 0 11px;">Verifying the Deployment, Function, Performance, and Design in the Configuration Similar to Commercial Environment</h3>

                        <P>The IT Infrastructure Division has obtained two servers equipped with Intel Optane persistent memory as evaluation machines, and decided to conduct verification in a configuration similar to a commercial environment. The company provides a commercial environment with 16 servers, 2 network devices and 1 storage unit in a single server rack. This time, two of the 16 servers in the server rack were replaced with evaluation machines, and the verification was performed without changing the network, storage, or virtualization environment configuration of VMware. “Our company increases availability by loosely coupling in every rack unit. Therefore, even if a failure occurs, the effect is limited within the rack, so it does not affect the whole,” says Omiya. The summary of the verification is as follows.</P>

                        <p>Building on its strong reputation for providing outstanding IT services to small and medium-sized enterprises in Finland and Sweden, managed services provider Prog-It has expanded its reach to help more companies reap the rewards of robust, reliable, and affordable IT.</p>
                        <P>As Prog-It’s client base increased, so did the complexity of its hosting infrastructure. Following several years of successful growth and multiple business acquisitions, Prog-It had built up a large estate of heterogeneous server, storage, and network hardware across three separate data centers.</P>
                        <P>Ossi Rajala, Sales Manager at Prog-It, takes up the story: “As we expanded our operations, we found that our infrastructure was gradually becoming harder to manage and more costly to maintain. As we relied on hardware from a variety of vendors, we were locked into expensive refresh cycles and costly hypervisor licenses.”</P>

                        <h3 style="font-weight: 350; margin: 2.5rem 0 11px;">Seizing Opportunities for Innovation</h3>
                        <p>With its existing vendor contracts due for renewal, Prog-It identified an opportunity to rationalize its data center operations and reduce costs.</p>
                        <p>Rajala comments: “We decided to consolidate our three data centers into a unified platform from a single provider. Taking this approach would help us to keep our IT costs low and make infrastructure management much simpler. Previously, we relied on small teams of experts to manage different hardware platforms and we wanted to establish an architecture that IT generalists could manage easily.”</p>
                        <p>As well as simplifying system management, Prog-It aimed to enhance its services to keep up with its clients’ evolving needs.</p>
                        <p>“Technology is constantly advancing, which creates new opportunities for our clients,” comments Rajala.</p>
                        <p>“In recent years, we’ve seen an increase in demand for self-service capabilities and reporting features,” he continues. “Clients also demand greater flexibility—they want to be able to spin up and spin down new environments for very short-term projects, such as development activities and proof of concepts, and pay for the resources they use on a per-day, per-hour or even per-minute basis. Our existing infrastructure limited our ability to deliver this level of elasticity.”</p>

                        <h3 style="font-weight: 350; margin: 2.5rem 0 11px;">Next-Generation Composable Cloud</h3>
                        <p>
                            Following an extensive vendor evaluation, Prog-It narrowed down its search to the Lenovo* ThinkAgile Series range. “Lenovo’s partnerships with some of the industry’s leading independent software vendors is what first attracted us to the ThinkAgile range. We liked the idea of all-in-one, integrated appliances, as it fit perfectly with our drive for simplification.”
                        </p>
                        <p>To help Prog-It choose the right ThinkAgile platform to meet it needs, Lenovo invited the company to visit its Executive Briefing Center (EBC) in the UK to test out the product range and speak to expert advisors. During its visit to the EBC, Prog-It made a comprehensive comparison of the different ThinkAgile platforms, and the Lenovo* ThinkAgile CP Series was the clear frontrunner.</p>
                        <p>ThinkAgile CP is a composable private cloud system, equipped with <a class="b_special_a1" href="">2nd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors,</a>  that enables administrators to dynamically allocate virtualized compute, storage and networking resources to provision private cloud services with ease. ThinkAgile CP supports multi-tenancy, with physical and logical workload and network isolation. Lenovo* ThinkAgile CP Cloud Controller provides a single pane of glass for managing tenancy, service catalogs, infrastructure lifecycle, orchestration, and workloads for an unlimited number of sites.</p>
                        <p>Rajala remarks: “One of the key deciding factors was the Lenovo solution’s built-in multi-tenancy capabilities, which enable us to keep client environments completely separate and secure.”</p>
                        <p>He adds: “We were also pleased that ThinkAgile CP came equipped with 2nd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors—the workload-optimized CPU platform delivers consistently high performance, ensuring that we can meet demanding service-level agreements.”</p>

                        <p>To ensure a smooth implementation, Prog-It enlisted the help of a third-party integration partner and received comprehensive training from the local Lenovo team in Finland.                </p>
                        <p>“Both the installation and the migration phases went very smoothly, and we gained a great deal of experience—we’re now experts in migrating from other hypervisors to the ThinkAgile CP platform,” says Rajala. “Whenever we encountered any roadblocks during the migration, the local Lenovo team were always on hand to help us push through them quickly and effectively.”</p>

                        <h3 style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: 350; margin: 2.5rem 0 11px;">Why Lenovo? Higher Productivity, Lower Cost Through Simpler, Automated Operations</h3>
                        <p>Since moving to the Lenovo* ThinkAgile CP platform, Prog-It has significantly reduced the size and complexity of its infrastructure, simplifying administration and cutting costs.</p>
                        <p>“The Lenovo* ThinkAgile CP Series platform gave us the opportunity to close down two of our three sites and run all of our operations from a single fault tolerant data center entity,” explains Rajala. “And because we’re now using the ThinkAgile CP virtualization software, we’ve made a huge saving on our hypervisor licenses. This translates into a significant reduction in our total cost of ownership [TCO]. And thanks to the Lenovo* CP Cloud Controller tool, we have managed to reduce the amount of time we spend on system administration by 75% each day, improving productivity and driving down costs further still.”</p>
                        <p>With ThinkAgile CP underpinning its operations, Prog-It is also better equipped to provide clients with tailored services and flexible pricing—sharpening its competitive edge.</p>
                        <p>“A lower TCO means that we can pass on cost-savings to clients,” says Rajala. “And because we can provision and manage data center resources much more easily than before, we can also offer more flexible pricing packages. For example, clients can pay for resources by the minute. They are delighted with this new approach, as it enables them to spin up and spin down temporary environments at their convenience, and only pay for the resources they need.</p>
