                            Technology, their Federated Learning Technology Team is exploring ways of aggregating
                            more-dimensional and higher-quality data from more sources using the federated learning
                            approach in order to improve AI model training. </p>
                        <p class="my-3">However, the exchange, transmission and aggregation of multi-source data also
                            brings complex data security issues, especially in sensitive industries and sectors, where
                            the risk of data breach is in the spotlight with attention of both authorities and the
                            general public. This has resulted in the introduction of a series of laws and regulations on
                            data protection. Without a secure, trusted multi-source data collaboration solution, it
                            would be difficult to break these silos of multi-source data and the development and
                            adoption of federated learning would undoubtedly be hindered.</p>
                        <p>A viable approach to address this problem is to create a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
                            in specific hardware with the support of hardware-enhanced security technologies to protect
                            sensitive data and applications from external access and attack. Through in-depth technical
                            cooperation with Intel, the Federated Learning Team successfully introduced Intel® Software
                            Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX) technology, a key pillar of the TEE solution, to its federated
                            learning solutions. By doing so, the Federated Learning Team pioneers the implementation of
                            AI training with a multi-source data collaboration solution, achieving noteworthy results in
                            areas such as insurance, healthcare, intelligent voice and Internet of Vehicles (IoV) with

                            the AI Training Evolution</h2>
                        <p>More mature algorithms and more plentiful computing power make large-scale and high-quality
                            data an important factor affecting AI performance. However, in the process of AI adoption in
                            various industries, insufficient training data has produced lackluster results in the
                            training of AI models since data sources which belong to different businesses and
                            departments are separated from each other. Traditionally, the system needs to integrate data
                            to train models with data from multiple sources, but this approach does not guarantee the
                            security of data exchange and increases the risk of data leakage.</p>
                        <p>As data security and privacy gain increasing attention, governments are increasing the
                            protection of them through laws and regulations. For example, the “Guideline for Internet
                            Personal Information Security Protection” officially released in China in April 2019 has
                            clear provisions for personal information sharing and transferring, and further strengthens
                            measures for personal information protection.1 In May 2019, the Cyberspace Administration of
                            China, together with relevant authorities, drafted the “Measures for Data Security
                            Management (Consultation Paper),” which provides clear opinions on and requirements for data
                            processing and utilization as well as supervision and management of data security.2 </p>
                        <p>AI training therefore requires a safe data aggregation method to enhance multi-source data
                            collaboration capabilities. With their sensibility to the development of AI and big data
                            technologies, the Federated Learning Team proactively explores the increasingly mature
                            federated learning approaches. Different from traditional data sharing methods, the data on
                            each node in the federated learning approach is kept on premises for the training, so each
                            data source is expected to participate in and promote optimization of the AI model and share
                            optimization results on the basis that data privacy is guaranteed.</p>
                        <p>Based on this concept, the Federated Learning Team has now built a Hive Platform for
                            Federated Learning to provide users with a one-stop solution to protect their data privacy
                            and security. While building the platform, the solution needs to resolve issues such as how
                            to further enhance the security of multi-source data on premises, how to provide a more
                            reliable security guarantee for the interim process of optimizing the AI model and how to
                            effectively evaluate the contribution of each data source to the final optimization result.
                            The Federated Learning Team and Intel have provided a better solution to these issues by
                            introducing Intel SGX technology.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;" class="fw-lighter">Hardware-Enhanced Security Technology
                            Empowers Federated Learning</h2>
                        <P>In the process of aggregating multi-source data to implement the AI model training with the
                            federated learning method, AI models or process parameters need to be transmitted and
                            exchanged at various data nodes through the network. It is well known that the greater the
                            data exposure is, the higher security risks that data faces. Therefore, no matter what
                            hardware infrastructures or operating systems in each node, or which network devices such as
                            routers and gateways are used, they could bring security risks like data leakage and
                            tampering if they become “polluted.”</P>
                        <P>For example, a hacker may intercept data messages by installing a sniffer in a transmitter on
                            the network or use a cold boot attack to read data remanence after the server has been
                            restarted, or even attack the data in memory directly by methods of memory bus snooping or
                            memory tampering. With an assortment of attack methods possible, it is difficult to secure
                            the system and build a bottom-up protection and prevention mechanism covering software and
                            hardware as well as the operating system. Efforts to build such a mechanism are a drain on
                            resources and will increase the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) without necessarily providing
                            satisfactory results in actual protection scenarios.</P>
                        <p>Building a TEE solution for trusted zones in hardware is a better option to solve these
                            issues. As a key element in the implementation of this solution, Intel SGX enables creation
                            of a trusted “enclave” in specific hardware (such as memory), with security boundaries of
                            data and applications limited to the "enclave" itself and the processor as shown in Figure
                            1. At the same time, its operation does not rely on other hardware or software, meaning that
                            data security and protection are independent of the operating system or hardware
                            configuration so that even if hardware drivers, virtual machines or the operating system
                            itself are attacked and destroyed, data leakage can be prevented more effectively.</p>

                        <p>The new 1+N solution architecture is shown in Figure 2. In it, an aggregator “enclave”
                            located at the center and N edge "enclaves" deployed elsewhere comprise a network.
                            “Enclaves” in the aggregator and data source systems are all trusted zones created in the
                            memory through processor instructions provided by Intel SGX.</p>

                        <p>In the 1+N solution, what needs to be transmitted in an encrypted channel are the AI model to
                            be trained and optimized and the related intermediate parameters, while training data, the
                            clear-text AI model and the AI algorithm are kept in the node where each data source is
                            located. In the initialization process, “enclaves” will generate public-private key pairs
                            themselves, with the public key being registered to the aggregator and the private key
                            stored in their own “enclaves” respectively. When training begins, the aggregator first
                            establishes an encrypted connection with the target “enclave.” The symmetric encrypted key
                            for this connection is provided through negotiation using the asymmetric algorithm of the
                            public-private key pairs, helping prevent a man-in-the-middle attack. After the connection
                            has been established, the aggregator first encrypts the AI model to be trained and pushes it
                            to each “enclave” and then each “enclave” decrypts the model and transmits it to the local
                            AI training environment to train the local data. After the training, the local AI training
                            environment returns the intermediate parameters of the training to the local “enclave.”</p>
                        <p>In response to business needs, the Team has innovated federated learning: all “enclaves” in
                            each local environment are trusted agents for the federation, and as the algorithm applied
                            at later stages is able to run in the “enclave” directly, the trusted agents will be able to
                            do more and more in the local environment. Next, the “enclave” will encrypt the intermediate
                            parameters in the encrypted connection and transmit back to the aggregator “enclave” which
                            will quickly aggregate the intermediate parameters it has received and optimize and adjust
                            the AI model according to the results before proceeding to the next iteration.</p>
                        <p>As the above processes are all implemented in “enclaves,” both the AI model and the
                            intermediate parameters are transmitted and exchanged in the encrypted channels and the
                            “enclaves” without any contact with external hardware or software throughout looping and
                            iteration of the solution, resulting in a more secure and trusted “internal loop.” Intel®
                            Architecture Processors provide powerful computing support for the construction of the
                            “enclave,” the laying of encrypted channels and the exchange and aggregation of intermediate
                            parameters.</p>
                        <p>To evaluate each node’s contribution to the training effect, in the 1+N solution all nodes
                            can first be trained to get the effect of total volume training when there are N data
                            sources. Subsequently, the N-1 nodes other than the node to be evaluated are trained
                            separately (for example, when evaluating Node 1, Nodes 2 to N are trained) and, after
                            obtaining models with different training effects, the system will calculate the
                            “contribution coefficient” of each data node in federated learning to get more accurate
                            evaluation of the contribution of each data node in the joint training of AI and adjust the
                            solution accordingly. These algorithms and scheduling may have an impact on the performance
                            of federated learning and it still needs to be proven whether they work in practice. As to
                            how to further use the “enclave” built on Intel® technology, there is indeed much room for
                            exploration and discovery.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;" class="fw-lighter">Results from Leading Federated Learning
                            Practices</h2>
                        <p>Let’s take the application of federated learning in the insurance industry as an example.
                            Before federated learning, the salesperson would determine the premium amount on a Policy
                            based only on basic information like the customer’s age and gender. However, with continuous
                            development of the information society, the amount and characteristics of user data have
                            significantly increased. For example, in terms of health insurance, accuracy of the
                            insured's health risk assessment will improve if the business system can make AI-enabled
                            predictions using large amounts of data including medical records and family history data to
                            obtain a more precise health assessment categorization.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, medical records and medical history is the kind of data that healthcare institutions
                            are required to keep absolutely private. It is not only impossible to disclose such data,
                            but the security level to protect them actually needs to be enhanced. Now, with the
                            introduction of a federated learning solution, insurers are able to conduct AI training on
                            insurance pricing models without touching the user data. According to front-line feedback
                            from some early, related projects, the federated learning 1+N solution can significantly
                            improve the effect of personalized insurance pricing.</p>

                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;" class="fw-lighter">Outlook
                        </h2>
                        <p>With the value of data increasing and due to a lack of effective data protection in some
                            industries, the phenomenon of data silos is increasingly becoming an issue. In response to
                            some of these data challenges to AI development, Dr. Jianzong Wang, a pioneer of federated
                            learning in China and head of Ping An Technology’s Federated Learning Technology Team, has
                            been leading his team to actively explore data safety and trusted collaborations in
                            multi-data source environments. The Team uses advanced federated learning methods to cope
                            with data challenges and have accumulated a wealth of experience for making breakthroughs in
                            this field. They have made a lot of achievements, providing a useful reference for
                            application of federated learning in different industrial sectors.</p>
                        <p>Currently the Team is using the federated learning method to develop a polymorphic and
                            multi-tasking learning model for the financial industry, which is under strong supervision
                            over data. This model is developed to meet the needs of banks and financial institutions in
                            various application scenarios such as risk assessment, anti-money laundering, investment
                            consulting, investment research, credit, insurance and supervision. By developing this
                            model, the Team aims to help users leverage AI capabilities to build more effective risk
                            control and marketing models as well as identifying potential financial risks such as credit
                            card fraud, overdue loans, financial fraud etc. thus reducing the operational risks to
                            financial businesses. At the same time, the federated learning method can help users utilize
                            horizontal data for user profiling, to expand sales channels and optimize marketing
                            strategies, providing an intelligent engine to improve sales capabilities.</p>
                        <p>In the future, the Federated Learning Team will further develop technological cooperation
                            with Intel to drive secure operation and efficient transformation of data resources in
                            federated learning with an increasing number of advanced technologies. And they will
                            collaborate with more businesses and institutions to break down data barriers and promote
                            the rapid development and application of federated learning in all walks of life.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Advantages of the Federated Learning Team’s Solution:</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Through processor instructions, Intel SGX creates memory “enclaves” that better ensure
                                data security on each node of federated learning for the exchange and transmission of
                                intermediate parameters, helping to prevent internal and external attacks and providing
                                more reliable security for implementation and exploration of federated learning in a
                                multi-source data environment.
                            </li>
                            <li>The 1+N federated learning solution which integrates Intel SGX helps to accurately evaluate the contribution of data on each node to the AI model training and facilitates a user’s ability to adjust the solution.</li>
