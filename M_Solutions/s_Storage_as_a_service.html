                                Storage as a Service (STaaS) is the practice of using public cloud storage resources to
                                store your data. Using STaaS is more cost efficient than building private storage
                                infrastructure, especially when you can match data types to cloud storage offerings.

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4" id="key1">What Is Storage as a Service?</h3>
                        <p class="my-0">Storage as a Service or STaaS is cloud storage that you rent from a Cloud
                            Service Provider (CSP) and that provides basic ways to access that storage. Enterprises,
                            small and medium businesses, home offices, and individuals can use the cloud for multimedia
                            storage, data repositories, data backup and recovery, and disaster recovery. There are also
                            higher-tier managed services that build on top of STaaS, such as Database as a Service, in
                            which you can write data into tables that are hosted through CSP resources.</p>
                        <p class="my-0">The key benefit to STaaS is that you are offloading the cost and effort to
                            manage data storage infrastructure and technology to a third-party CSP. This makes it much
                            more effective to scale up storage resources without investing in new hardware or taking on
                            configuration costs. You can also respond to changing market conditions faster. With just a
                            few clicks you can rent terabytes or more of storage, and you don’t have to spin up new
                            storage appliances on your own.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5" id="key2">How Does Storage as a Service Work? </h3>
                        <p class="my-0">Some STaaS offerings can be rented based on quantity, others are rented based on
                            a service level agreement (SLA). SLAs help establish and reinforce conditions for using data
                            storage, such as uptime and read/write access speed. The storage you choose will typically
                            depend on how often you intend to access the data. Cold data storage is data that you leave
                            alone or access infrequently, whereas warm or hot data is accessed regularly and repeatedly.
                            Pricing by quantity tends to be more cost efficient but isn’t intended to support fast and
                            frequent access for day-to-day business productivity. For hot or warm data, an SLA will be
                            crucial to leveraging data storage in support of current projects or ongoing processes.</p>
                        <p class="my-0">
                            Many CSPs make it easy to onboard and upload data into their STaaS infrastructure for little
                            to no cost at all. However, there may be hidden fees and it can be extremely costly to
                            migrate or transfer your data to a different cloud platform.
                        </p>

                        <h5 class="fw-bold my-3">Understanding Data Types</h5>
                        <ul>
                            Another factor that influences cost is the type of data storage used. There are three main
                            types of cloud storage: block storage, file storage, and object-based storage.
                            <li><b>Block storage</b>&nbsp; breaks data into segmented pieces and distributes them to the
                                storage environment wherever it is most efficient for the platform to do so. This
                                simulates the same functionality as writing data to a standard hard disk drive or
                                solid-state drive. Data remains available for quick access, but it is also costly to
                                maintain and works best for warm or hot data storage.</li>
                            <li><b>File storage</b>&nbsp; lists data in a navigable hierarchy, usually a file directory.
                                This is most like the file storage system that you would find on a PC or in cloud
                                storage apps like Microsoft OneDrive. Because it is designed for humans to navigate,
                                file storage is ideal anytime you need to collaborate on a project with other people or
                                businesses. Whether the data is hot or cold doesn’t matter as much. However, file
                                storage does not scale well. The more files you add, the more complex the system becomes
                                and the more difficult it is to navigate.</li>
                            <li><b>Object-based storage</b>&nbsp; organizes data by adding meta information to it,
                                making it easy to recognize and retrieve at any time. This type of cloud storage scales
                                up in the most cost-efficient manner, because you can keep adding to it. It is typically
                                the least expensive type of STaaS and best suited for massive amounts of cold media or
                                data files.</li>

                    <p class="my-0">Many customers assume that maintaining a private cloud or on-premises data center
                        storage is the best way to ensure security and control over their data. It’s true that the risk
                        to a STaaS provider is far greater because they have a much larger attack surface than a single
                        business or user. However, STaaS providers on average are more secure than private clouds
                        precisely because of this elevated risk. STaaS providers must become experts in cloud security,
                        which means they have more dedicated personnel, policies, and strategies in place to help
                        safeguard data storage.</p>
                    <p class="my-0">
                        The nature of these risks is also different for STaaS providers than for businesses or
                        individual users and extends from basic platform hardening and antimalware measures to things
                        like multitenancy. Customers may also introduce vulnerabilities that a CSP has very little
                        control over.
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="fw-bold my-3">Multitenancy</h5>
                    <p class="my-0">
                        In a cloud environment, compute and storage resources are abstracted from the hardware layer and
                        made available in virtual pools, either through virtual machines (VMs) or containers. Multiple
                        VMs and containers can run on the same physical server. Your data and applications are
                        oftentimes sharing the same bare metal resources as the data and applications of other
                        customers. This is called multitenancy, as there are multiple tenants or customers sharing the
                        same physical resources. Vulnerabilities in another tenant’s workloads can expose your workloads
                        to risks.
                    </p>
                    <p class="my-0">Workload isolation is the main antidote to the problem. VMs and containers are
                        inherently isolated, but additional hardware-enabled protections can also help. For example, <a
                            href="../rushita_Solutions/k_solutions_Topics_viewall_Cloud-Technology_ Softwar_Gaurd.html"
                            class="s_link_dark1">Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX)</a> is designed to create
                        trusted memory enclaves within a platform to isolate and help protect data both in transit or in
                        use.</p>

                    <h5 class="fw-bold my-3">Customer Vulnerabilities</h5>
                    <p class="my-0">
                        For STaaS customers, the main security concern will be managing who within their organization
                        has access to the data and what level of permissions they have, such as read-only vs. read and
                        write–level access. CSPs don’t control who can access their customers’ devices, so it’s
                        important to be vigilant against threats such as email phishing schemes that can create
                        vulnerability in your point of access. Using strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and
                        following other best practices can add more layers of protection.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="fw-bold my-3">Provider Practices</h5>
                    <p class="my-0">
                        Cloud security in STaaS is primarily the concern of the CSP who manages the cloud storage environment. It’s up to the CSP to treat vulnerabilities in both the hardware and software layers and address the human element by ensuring that all personnel in charge of maintaining the cloud infrastructure are trustworthy and follow best practices. The customer in this case should become educated and learn how to ask pointed questions about security when deciding which CSP to choose.
