                            <p>Increasingly, a variety of modern computing workloads are better served with flexible CPU
                                systems that can scale compute performance through improved core performance or higher
                                core density. In addition, power efficiency is becoming a more central aspect of data
                                center server architecture and design. A state of the art many-core CPU implementation
                                today requires more silicon area (span) than a single lithography reticle field
                                (~800mm2). This in turn necessitates a disaggregated architecture and drives the need
                                for advanced packaging technologies to maximize die-to-die communication bandwidth while
                                minimizing any latency penalty. In order to meet these needs, Intel has pioneered a
                                number of new technologies in its Intel 18A process node as well as its advanced
                                packaging and assembly techniques.</p>

                            <p>RibbonFET is the most significant change to transistor architecture after today’s FinFET
                                transistor. The FinFET architecture was refined and optimized over the last 15 years to
                                improve performance and power efficiency. But at today’s geometries, FinFET has reached
                                its limits and is no longer able to provide additional gain in performance or power. The
                                RibbonFET transistor further improves the electrostatics of the FinFET by wrapping the
                                transistor gate all around the channel which takes the shape of narrow ribbons of
                                silicon. Intel® Xeon® processors (codenamed Clearwater Forest) will leverage Intel’s
                                second generation RibbonFET Technology (Intel 18A) to build the primary compute CPU
                                chiplets. RibbonFET is expected to deliver exceptional energy efficiency improvement
                                over today’s FinFET transistor.</p>

                            <h3 class="mt-5">PowerVia</h3>
                            <p>Since the very first integrated circuit nearly 5 decades ago, metal wires to interconnect
                                transistors have always been on the top of the transistor layer (front-side
                                interconnects), while the substrate under the transistors has always been primarily a
                                structural support layer. Starting with its Intel 20A process node, Intel is changing
                                this paradigm to introduce metal interconnects below the transistor layer (back-side
                                interconnects). In the old paradigm, the front-side interconnect architecture was shared
                                among wires to route electrical signals between transistors and wires to deliver power
                                to the transistors. With the introduction of PowerVia technology on Intel 20A, signal
                                routing and power delivery are decoupled for the first time. This enables the front-side
                                interconnect architecture to be optimized for signal routing while a new back-side
                                interconnect architecture can be independently optimized for power delivery. This
                                decoupling enables improved routability (thus saving chip area and power) and also lower
                                voltage droop (thus enabling more performance at a given supply voltage).</p>

                            <h3 class="mt-5">Foveros Direct 3D</h3>
                            <p>Foveros Direct 3D is an Intel technology that enables direct attach of one or more
                                chiplets to an active base tile to create complex system modules. “Direct” attach is
                                achieved by thermocompression bonding of copper vias on individual chiplets to those on
                                a wafer or even direct bonding of entire wafers stacked atop each other. The attachment
                                can be “Face-to-Face” or “Face-to-Back” and can include chips or wafers from different
                                source foundries, offering more flexibility in product architecture. The connection
                                bandwidth is determined by the copper via pitch (and resulting density). The first
                                generation of Foveros Direct 3D will use copper bonding at a pitch of 9um while the
                                second generation will shrink the pitch to just 3um.</p>
                            <p>This unit of CPU chiplets sitting atop a large “local” cache becomes a complete compute
                                module, which can then be replicated to scale up compute capability and create a SKU
                                stack based on core count and cache requirements.</p>

                            <h3 class="mt-5">EMIB 3.5D</h3>
                            <p>Embedded Multi-die Integrated Bridge (EMIB) is a proven Intel technology that enables
                                high bandwidth connectivity between multiple large chiplets without using a silicon
                                interposer. EMIB technology can also be used to connect multiple compute modules
                                constructed using Foveros Direct 3D technology as described earlier. This combination of
                                EMIB and Foveros in a single package is called EMIB 3.5D and enables the creation of
                                flexible, heterogeneous computing systems. Individual tiles or modules can be identical
                                (e.g., to create a scalable compute architecture) or they can be disparate (e.g., to
                                connect compute modules with I/O tiles or with DRAM modules). The scalability and
                                flexibility enabled by EMIB 3.5D allows the creation of systems in package with total
                                silicon surface area far greater than that achieved by silicon interposers alone. Intel
                                Foundry customers can leverage 2nd generation EMIB technology (bump pitch scaled from 55
                                micron to 45 micron) to achieve high bandwidth connectivity with either Foveros Direct
                                3D chiplets or multiple I/O chiplets.</p>

                            <p>In addition to the wide capabilities of advanced 3D packaging, Intel also has specific
                                architectures and design techniques to deliver cost-optimized packaging. One such
                                architecture is called Intel Foundry FCBGA 2D+ (Flip Chip Ball Grid Array 2D+). The
                                schematic rendering below shows the high-level concept of Intel Foundry FCBGA 2D+.</p>
                            <p>In the Intel Foundry FCBGA 2D+ architecture, the finer feature (expensive) capabilities
                                of organic substrate technology are invoked in a smaller footprint (a high-density
                                “patch” substrate) and assembled onto an interposer (larger footprint) which invokes
                                “printed circuit board” or PCB-like capabilities at a lower cost. This composite
                                (package-on-package) is then assembled onto a board. Overall cost reduction gains using
                                such an architecture for Intel Xeon processors can easily be in the hundreds of millions
                                of dollars. Intel has been successfully deploying this technology in its Intel Xeon
                                product line for several generations. More recently, as the interconnect speeds continue
                                to rise and electrical margins make it challenging to overcome the margin loss
                                implications (discontinuity in the electrical path), material advancements and design
                                techniques have been developed which can help realize PCIe Gen6, DDR5, and MR DIMM like

                            <h3 class="mt-5">Mix and Match: Multiple Process Nodes in a Package</h3>
                            <p>Best-in-class high performance computing products require a significant silicon span
                                (total silicon surface area) within a package. This is driven by increasing core counts,
                                increasing I/O and connectivity requirements, increasing accelerator IP content and
                                other functionality. This requirement makes disaggregation a necessity for high
                                performance computing products today and even more so in the future. As is well
                                documented, smaller chiplets are easier to yield than large, near-reticle sized chips.
                                Advanced packaging technologies like Foveros Direct 3D and EMIB 3.5D enable larger than
                                reticle silicon spans as described earlier—but they also enable significantly more
                                choices and flexibility in product architecture. Leveraging this flexibility, not only
                                can architects now break up large monolithic chips into identical tiny chiplets to
                                improve yield (and hence cost), but they can also disaggregate functional blocks into
                                unique chiplets. This enables disaggregation by process node—allowing less scalable IP
                                (e.g., analog and SRAM) to be retained on trailing edge geometries, while only migrating
                                more scalable IP (e.g., digital logic) to leading edge geometries. Technologies like
                                Foveros Direct 3D also enable the combination of chiplets from disparate sources
                                (foundries) which adds even more flexibility to product architecture.</p>

                        <p><i>Figure 8. Innovative construction enables mix and match of multiple different process
                                technologies to optimize fab yield, unit cost, and design turnaround time.</i></p>
                        <p class="mt-5">Compute chiplets benefit the most from geometry scaling and will leverage Intel 18A
                            technology for best-in-class performance-power-area (PPA). The size of an individual compute
                            chiplet is chosen to optimize process yield while also enabling modularity in product
                            architecture. Compute chiplets are stacked atop an active base tile using Foveros Direct 3D
                            as described earlier. The base tile can contain logic and memory IP for data caching and
                            routing from I/O to cores and between cores. The base tile can leverage previous designs
                            using a previous generation process node to lower R&D costs while providing adequate
                            functionality. The I/O tiles can also reuse investments from previous products speeding
                            development turnaround time (TAT) and provides a significant product cost advantage. These
                            ingredients can be mixed and matched in future products as needs arise for different
                            processor core IPs and/or I/O functionality enabling derivative products relatively quickly,
                            while retaining the existing system architecture.</p>
                        <p>Bringing these flexible architecture advancements to market represents Intel’s vision for
                            computing systems of the future, and a moment where these innovative technologies come
                            together in a package that will significantly advance data center computing. Intel 18A,
                            Foveros Direct 3D and EMIB 3.5D are ready for design by Intel Foundry customers and will
                            debut in the market in 2025 in a future Intel Xeon processor, codenamed Clearwater Forest.
