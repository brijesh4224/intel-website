                        <p class="fw-bold mt-5 pt-4" id="key1">What is a CPU?</p>
                        <p>Constructed from billions of transistors, the central processing unit (CPU) can have multiple processing cores and is commonly referred to as the “brain” of the computer. It is essential to all modern computing systems, as it executes the commands and processes needed for your computer and operating system. The CPU is also important in determining how fast programs can run while doing tasks such as surfing the web, running calculations for game physics and other programs, or building spreadsheets.</p>
                        <p class="fw-bold mt-5 pt-4" id="key2">What is a GPU?</p>
                        <p>The graphics processing unit (GPU) has many smaller, more specialized cores. These cores deliver massive performance by working together and dividing processing tasks across many cores simultaneously (or in parallel). The GPU excels at highly parallel tasks like rendering visuals during gameplay, manipulating video data during content creation, and computing results in intensive AI workloads.</p>

                        <p class="fw-bold mt-5 pt-4" id="key3">What is the difference between a CPU and a GPU?</p>
                        <p>CPUs and GPUs have a lot in common: both are critical computing engines, both are silicon-based microprocessors, and both handle data. But CPUs and GPUs have different architectures and are built for different purposes.</p>
                        <p>The CPU is suited for various tasks, especially those for which latency or per-core performance is important. A powerful execution engine, the CPU focuses its fewer cores on individual tasks and getting things done quickly. This makes it uniquely well-equipped for jobs ranging from serial computing, where only one task is executed at a time on a single processor, to running databases.</p>
                        <p>GPUs began as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) designed for specialized purposes such as accelerating graphics and 3D rendering tasks like gaming. Over time, these fixed-function engines became more programmable and more flexible. While graphics and hyper-realistic gaming visuals remain their principal function, GPUs have become more general-purpose parallel processors, able to execute many tasks simultaneously to handle a growing range of applications, including AI.</p>
                        <p>Today, it is no longer a question of CPU versus GPU. More than ever, you need both to meet your varied computing demands. The best results are achieved when the right tool is used for the job.</p>

                        <p class="fw-bold mt-5 pt-4" id="key4">What about a CPU/GPU combination?</p>
                        <p>Some CPUs include a GPU on the same chip for built-in graphics and additional benefits. This CPU/GPU combination does not require additional dedicated or discrete graphics. It is often used in devices where compact size and energy efficiency are important, such as laptops, tablets, smartphones, and some desktops.</p>
                        <p>CPUs with built-in GPUs deliver space-, cost-, and energy-efficiency benefits over dedicated graphics processors. Plus, they provide the horsepower to handle the processing of graphics-related data and instructions for common tasks. Processors with built-in graphics are great for light gaming, streaming media, and video editing.</p>

                        <p class="fw-bold mt-5 pt-4" id="key5">Accelerating deep learning and AI</p>
                        <p>Today, certain CPUs also come with neural processing units (NPUs), which work with GPUs directly on the processor to perform the kind of high-performance inferencing tasks required by AI. These specialized processors accelerate AI tasks and are ideal for preparing pre-trained neural networks for the inferencing stage of AI—where capabilities learned during the training stage are used to make predictions. As AI becomes increasingly important, the NPU/GPU combination will become a mainstay of future computing systems.</p>
                        <p>With sufficient RAM, the CPU/NPU/GPU processor offers a great testbed for deep learning and AI.</p>
