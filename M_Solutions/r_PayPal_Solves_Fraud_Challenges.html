                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Executive Summary</h2>
                        <p><a href="">PayPal</a> is the world’s largest online money transfer, billing, and payments
                            system. It owns
                            the PayPal, Venmo, iZettle, Xoom, Braintree, and Paydiant brands. By leveraging technology
                            to make financial services and commerce more convenient, affordable, and secure, the PayPal
                            platform empowers more than 325 million consumers and merchants in more than 200 markets to
                            join and thrive in the global economy. But, like any banking service, PayPal faces fraud
                            challenges. By adopting new Intel® technologies and <a href="">Aerospike’s </a> real-time
                            data platform,
                            PayPal reduced the number of missed fraudulent transactions by 30X by improving Service
                            Level Agreement (SLA) adherence to 99.95% up from 98.5%, while using a computing footprint
                            8X smaller than its previous infrastructure (1,024 servers down to 120), enabling an
                            increase in the amount of data evaluated by 10X.1</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Challenge</h2>
                        <p>PayPal’s fraud rate is between 0.17 and 0.18 percent of revenue.2 While this number is well
                            below the industry average of 1.86 percent,2 it still represents over 1 billion dollars a
                            year in losses for the firm.</p>
                        <p>To identify emerging fraud patterns in real-time, PayPal needed to process and analyze more
                            data faster. PayPal sought to quickly build a real-time decision-making platform that was
                            highly effective while minimizing end-user friction. The platform merged big data with
                            real-time processing, such as customer enrollment, payment, invoicing preferences, and
                            profile data.</p>
                        <p>Scaling the amount of data processed, however, introduced challenges that included a large
                            primary index, hundreds of petabytes of data, and a requirement to double the online
                            transaction processing (OLTP) rate from 3.5 to 7 million transactions per second. PayPal
                            determined that the massive amounts of data it was collecting was dragging down its existing
                            database. The legacy database could not deliver results without a deterioration in
                            performance. PayPal needed a cost-effective IT strategy that would allow their
                            infrastructure to scale horizontally, while also ensuring that performance and uptime did
                            not suffer. In 2015, they chose Aerospike and its NoSQL database system.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Solution</h2>
                        <p>PayPal’s infrastructure supported over 4,000 database instances, 100 petabytes of data, and
                            32 percent data storage growth each year. However, as data volumes in its fraud
                            decision-making platform grew each year, so did the size of the primary index. Once the
                            memory capacity in a node was exhausted, it could no longer store new data, even if storage
                            capacity was still available. Scaling out to additional nodes came at a significant cost,
                            including upfront hardware costs, staff to manage the nodes, and increased power
                            consumption. In order to keep database node counts down, PayPal continually looked for ways
                            to increase the density per node.</p>
                        <p>Aerospike’s database is designed with a patented Hybrid Memory Architecture™ (HMA) that
                            delivers a fundamentally different approach from traditional databases. To deliver
                            predictable performance up to petabyte scale, Aerospike is built explicitly to leverage the
                            hardware advancements of flash (SSD) storage and persistent memory instead of relying on
                            DRAM. Using Aerospike allowed PayPal to scale with higher storage density and fast SSDs,
                            while storing only the primary index in memory for fast data access.</p>
                        <p>In 2019, PayPal began to look at next-generation memory and storage options to increase their
                            overall storage density and reduce their DRAM costs using Aerospike. When Intel® Optane™
                            persistent memory (Intel® Optane™ PMem) launched, Aerospike had already optimized its
                            software to take advantage of the new PMem modules. Intel Optane PMem delivers a unique
                            combination of affordable large capacity and non-volatility. 2nd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable
                            processors are designed to take advantage of Intel Optane PMem in servers.</p>
                        <p>Aerospike’s HMA now offers the option to store the primary index in Intel Optane PMem instead
                            of DRAM. Since Intel Optane PMem is available in 128, 256, or 512 GB modules at a lower cost
                            per GB than DRAM, PayPal was able to significantly increase the memory capacity of each
                            node. With more room for the primary index, they could now build smaller clusters with
                            denser nodes. This greatly reduced the need to scale out, while still maintaining the high
                            performance PayPal expects.</p>
                        <p>Persistence is an additional benefit PayPal gained by storing the primary index in Intel
                            Optane PMem. With indexes in DRAM, a system restart required scanning data from storage to
                            rebuild the index, but with indexes persisted across restarts, the entire system can now be
                            restored and back online in a fraction of the time. Faster server restarts support PayPal’s
                            requirements for high uptime and better reliability.</p>
                        <p>More recently, a multiyear collaboration between Intel and Aerospike has resulted in further
                            optimizations that include the option to store data (not just indexes) in Intel Optane PMem
                            as well.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Result</h2>
                        <p>PayPal now has a total of 2,000 Aerospike servers, including 200 high-density servers with
                            2nd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors and Intel Optane PMem. The company expects continued
                            growth, and by scaling its infrastructure with these new technologies, PayPal lowered TCO
                            through DRAM reduction, while maintaining extremely fast application response and low
                            latency. Additional benefits include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>4X increase</strong>in storage per node (from 3.2 to 12 TB)1</li>
                            <li><strong>2X reduction</strong>in servers1</li>
                            <li><strong>30 percent reduction</strong> in costs per cluster1</li>
                            <li><strong>12X reduction</strong>in re-indexing time1</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Based on PayPal’s initial projected fraud data size of 50 TB in 2015 with its legacy
                            in-memory system, the Aerospike HMA, Intel® processors, and Intel Optane PMem allowed PayPal
                            to achieve the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>30X reduction</strong>in the number of fraud transactions missed by improving
                                SLA
                                adherence to 99.95% up from 98.5%1</li>
                            <li><strong>8X reduction</strong>in server footprint: from 1,024 servers down to 1201</li>
                            <li><strong>Costs reduced by 3X:</strong> USD9 million hardware cost savings projected from
                                USD12.5 million down to USD3.5 million1</li>
                            <li><strong>5X throughput improvement:</strong>from 200K to 1M transactions per second1</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As PayPal’s annual projected data is expected to grow 32 percent, Aerospike and Intel Optane
                            PMem enable the PayPal fraud solution to cost effectively scale. PayPal can continue to meet
                            99.95 percent fraud calculation SLAs. PayPal also benefits from slashed node restart times,
                            improved query performance, and data consistency, plus maintaining consistent high
                            availability 24/7 (99.99 percent uptime).</p>
                        <p>Fraud prevention is an important area of investment for PayPal. The company has successfully
                            used real-time decision-making with robust fraud prevention models for more than a decade.
                            However, fraudsters are constantly changing their patterns and uncovering new ways to take
                            advantage of the system. As a result, PayPal must continuously find ways to improve fraud
                            detection accuracy and decrease fraud detection time. PayPal continues to work with
                            Aerospike and Intel to advance approaches to detect and stop fraud with higher decision
                            confidence.</p>
