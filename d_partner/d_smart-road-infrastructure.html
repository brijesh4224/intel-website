                            Cities are facing pressures to address environmental issues caused by traffic congestion and
                            urban population growth while providing more equitable mobility and sustainable
                            transportation. Smart road technology helps city planners and governments address these
                            challenges. The Internet of Things (IoT) is making road transportation more connected, safe,
                            sustainable, and efficient with traffic management, pedestrian and vehicle safety,
                            environmental monitoring, smart and connected roadway corridors, and EV charging and parking
                            networks.</p>

                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">What Is Smart Road Technology?</h2>
                        <p>With new pressures for cities to develop more effective roadways and highways, smart
                            infrastructure is essential for modernization. Smart roads built on IoT and information and
                            communications technology (ICT) can make it possible for cities and transportation
                            authorities to collect and analyze data to improve day-to-day traffic management. Smart road
                            infrastructure can also help cities adapt for long-term sustainable transportation needs.
                            With IoT sensors, cameras, radar, and 5G-equipped technologies, data can be analyzed in
                            near-real time and used to improve congested roadways, streamlining traffic flow. Data can
                            also be sent to the cloud for long-term analysis, providing critical insight for efforts
                            such as reducing CO2 emissions.</p>
                        <p>Edge computing opens myriad possibilities for smart and connected roads. It enables low
                            latency for the analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) that power smart road
                            infrastructure, like adaptive traffic lights and integrated roadways. For example, traffic
                            lights that automatically adjust their timing based on sensor data can enhance the flow of
                            traffic or change signals to help protect others on the road from dangerous drivers.</p>

                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Benefits of Smart Roads and Smart Infrastructure</h2>
                        <p>There are many types of devices that enable smart road technology: speed sensors, acoustic
                            sensors, IP CCTV cameras, smart traffic lights, condition and weather monitoring systems,
                            and digital signage. When these devices collect and analyze data in near-real time, cities
                            can realize several benefits:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Less congested streets.</b>For an average US citizen, congestion costs 99 hours of
                                their time and USD 1,377 each year.1 Smart road technology can track vehicles and adjust
                                traffic lights based on traffic conditions, helping prevent bumper-to-bumper traffic.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Improved traffic and pedestrian safety.</b>Pedestrian deaths have risen by a
                                staggering 46 percent over the past decade compared to a 5 percent increase in all other
                                traffic-related fatalities.2 Smart roadside equipment deployed in intersections can
                                provide alerts that enhance safety for vulnerable road users, including pedestrians,
                                bicyclists, and motorcyclists.</li>
                            <li><b>Extended connectivity alongside transportation infrastructure.</b>Roadside network
                                deployments can extend and improve wireless public/private connectivity and the use of
                                intelligent transportation system (ITS) applications on roadways and transportation
                                corridors, including those that were previously unconnected. This results in improved
                                coverage and access to near-real-time insight into activities and events happening on
                                roadways that can be used to proactively address problem areas, reduce response times,
                                and improve overall road safety.</li>
                            <li><b>Enhanced parking and e-tolling.</b>E-tolling can reduce congestion by using license
                                plate recognition and vehicle tracking to automatically charge highway and bridge
                                tolling fees—all without making vehicles stop or slow down.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>By sending select data to the cloud to be analyzed over time, cities can make continual
                            improvements in traffic management, road maintenance, and sustainability. Cities can also
                            use digital twin technology to create virtual city models using real data to continuously
                            evaluate and improve current infrastructure as well as test new technologies prior to full
                            investment. Smart road technology can enable cities to assist in the following ways:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Improved services and emergency response.</b>Creating a digital twin environment
                                powered by Intel® technologies can enable roadside infrastructure to provide on-demand
                                commercial services to vehicles or other road users and can help alert first responders
                                to accidents.</li>
                            <li><b>Improved road layout and pavement conditions.</b>Road condition monitoring solutions
                                can help city planners analyze the rate of collisions and near misses as well as assess
                                road and pavement conditions. This aids in proactively identifying needed road layout
                                changes and pavement improvements. Delayed improvements can result in increased costs
                                for cities, up to 150 percent per lane/km/year.</li>
                            <li><b>Sustainable transportation.</b>Smart infrastructure enables optimization of traffic
                                flow and standardization of EV charging networks, helping to promote the use of lower
                                emission vehicles and reduce carbon emissions from daily transportation.</li>

                        <p>Policies and standards are critical for deploying IoT technologies in transportation. As a member of 5GAA, Intel is working with policy makers, automakers, manufacturers, and infrastructure owner-operators to deploy digital infrastructure such as cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) around the world. This 5G standards–based technology helps ensure that vehicles, infrastructure, and other road users are connected to mobilize safely. Intel has also been an active member of technical bodies and contributes to standards development for collaborative perception, maneuver coordination, and misbehavior detection.</p>

                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Intel® Technologies for Smart Roads</h2>
                        <p>Sensors, AI, and intelligent cameras are some of the driving IoT technologies that make smart infrastructure possible. Intel and our partners have developed technologies and hardware to assist in edge and cloud computing for smart road technology. We provide prevalidated reference designs and reference implementations to enable solutions that modernize road infrastructure.</p>
                        <p><b>Roadside Unit Reference Design</b></p>
                        <p>The Intel® reference design for roadside edge computing powers a unit that can be attached to streetlights and other fixtures. This roadside unit is ideal for real-time video analytics and other performance-hungry tasks. Cities can deploy these units as part of a solution for smart streetlights, smart traffic lights, smart parking, or e-tolling stations. They deliver the processing capabilities needed to detect license plates, spot pedestrians, and monitor traffic congestion.</p>
                        <p><b>Converged Edge Reference Architecture (CERA)</b></p>
                        <p><a href="">CERA is a reference architecture</a> for IoT and networking workload convergence. With this architecture, Intel partners can design solutions for roadside equipment to process sensor modalities and perform sensor fusion. This brings intelligence to the edge while hosting 5G network capabilities and microservices.</p>
                        <p>Solutions built on this platform can be set up at intersections or on-premises for near-edge computing and data processing for multiple IoT devices. Solutions can be optimized using the <a href="">Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit</a> and <a href="">Intel® Smart Edge Open Toolkit</a>. With 5G connectivity, CERA provides networking capabilities that allow IoT devices to communicate with each other at the edge or send data to the cloud. It processes the information from cameras, radar, and a wide range of other sensors.</p>
                        <p><b>Reference Implementations</b></p>
                        <p>Intel® reference implementations offer preconfigured software for a complete sample application. Our <a href="">intelligent traffic management</a> reference implementation is designed to monitor intersections via IP cameras to optimize the flow of traffic. Our <a href="">wireless network-ready intelligent traffic management</a> reference implementation is hosted with Smart Edge Open, which contains all the necessary software stacks to host a 5G RAN.</p>
                        <p>In addition, Intel provides a portfolio of other technologies that enable low latency and efficient connectivity.</p>
