                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-4">Transforming Financial Transactions</h3>
                        <p>Caja Huancayo is a leading microfinance institution in Peru with 4,424 internal collaborators
                            across its 190 nationwide agencies. The organization’s rapid growth in recent years
                            demonstrates its industry leadership in financial inclusion and reputation for excellence in
                            customer service. Its primary customer base is small-scale entrepreneurs from rural zones
                            looking for access to capital. Given the challenges of on-site IT support due to distance,
                            access, and the global pandemic, the ability for its IT team to manage network devices
                            remotely was a priority.</p>
                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Challenge: Peak Productivity Without Extra Budget</h3>
                        <p>Caja Huancayo’s team of IT technicians manages a fleet of desktop PCs in its local banking
                            branches across Peru. The team was tasked with finding a management solution with remote
                            power control, visibility into fleet diagnostics, and technical intervention capabilities to
                            support internal users without service impact. The most common service requests from users
                            include resetting passwords, updating security patches at the workstation level, and
                            assigning computers to new personnel.</p>
                        <p>The IT team also needed an efficient, centralized “line of sight” to catalog device features
                            and conditions. However, there was a lack of project implementation agility as well as an
                            inability to propose business impact projects to address this gap. Device maintenance had to
                            be coordinated manually, which was inconvenient and allowed potential for human error. With
                            the organizational goal of strengthening service capacity and providing prompt support to
                            internal users, the team knew they needed to enhance efficiencies.</p>
                        <p>Microfinance institutions like Caja Huancayo emerged as a tool to increase development and
                            reduce poverty by granting small loans to entrepreneurs and small business owners. As a
                            result, more people in rural areas can access financial services to support their
                            entrepreneurial endeavors.<sup>1</sup> Since financial service providers are scarce in these
                            regions, Caja Huancayo felt additional pressure to remove roadblocks that could hinder
                            business continuity, such as employee availability and efficiency. COVID-19 increased the
                            challenge, as more transactions needed support with fewer resources. The institution wanted
                            peak productivity while making the most of current rented equipment without spending extra
                            budget.</p>
                        <p>Caja Huancayo’s head of information security, Enrique Mendoza Caballero, and his team of
                            technicians met with computer manufacturers to explore potential solutions. However, they
                            found no solution with the remote power capabilities they needed.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">The institution’s workforce was already using rented devices on the <a

                            While Caja Huancayo had been benefiting from built-in Intel vPro platform features like
                            business-class performance, hardware-based security, and PC fleet stability, they did not
                            fully understand how activating the platform’s manageability tools could help address their
                            needs.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Solution: Simple Activation with Remote Tech Support</h3>
                        <p>Several factors were important for Mendoza Caballero and his technical team when choosing a
                            comprehensive remote management solution.</p>
                        <p>Intel was invited to evaluate the Caja Huancayo team’s challenges against their goals. As
                            part of the process, Intel explained that the Intel vPro platform remote manageability
                            capabilities could be harnessed at no additional cost, as the technology was already on the
                            fleet’s computers. The team could simply activate the platform’s Intel AMT, then optimize it
                            with support from the Intel team. This technology enables IT teams to remotely power devices
                            on or off as well as troubleshoot endpoints with keyboard, video, mouse (KVM) functions.
                            Additionally, Intel AMT streamlines device administration with efficient patch updates.</p>
                        <p>In partnership with the Intel technical team, Mendoza Caballero and his team defined the
                            technological innovation parameters by device. The immediate challenge was to activate the
                            fleet of devices with Intel AMT for centralized device control with minimal disruption.
                            Accordingly, the team determined a rollout plan that would support business as usual.</p>
                        <p>To deploy in an accelerated time frame, the IT team leveraged Intel EMA, a software product
                            that communicates with devices to streamline management. “The beauty of Intel EMA is that
                            the tool can detect the Intel vPro devices and automate the configuration process of Intel
                            AMT,” Mendoza Caballero says.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">The first step in the implementation process was to configure branch devices to the Intel EMA
                            server. The server generates and installs an agent that automatically detects and activates
                            Intel AMT on all Intel vPro-powered devices. Devices with this technology activated use a
                            corporate-grade firmware called <a
                                href="#">Intel®
                                Management Engine (Intel® ME)</a>, which reports to the EMA server, allowing IT teams to
                            send manageability commands. Mendoza Caballero and his team were impressed by the
                            streamlined approach. “The activation of Intel vPro manageability tools was really simple.
                            Gaining centralized device control was easier than we could have imagined,” he says. The
                            team also leveraged the Intel EMA API for process automation. This includes sending the
                            power-on commands to unattended devices in remote branch offices and centralizing real-time
                            device life cycle information.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the implementation process, activation questions and challenges were easily
                            resolved through weekly virtual meetings and troubleshooting with Intel technical support.
                            Mendoza Caballero attributes the success of the activation to continuous communication with
                            the Intel team. “Intel’s abilities and capabilities demonstrated what next-level
                            professionalism, dedication, and coordination look like throughout this project,” he says.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Better Service with Energy Savings</h3>
                        <p>Caja Huancayo’s IT team addressed and resolved key business challenges by activating the
                            Intel vPro platform’s remote manageability tools:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Allowed remote power capabilities without user intervention</li>
                            <li>Gained and centralized device life cycle visibility and transparency with equipment
                                manufacturers with data consumed through the EMA API</li>
                            <li>Enabled preemptive online diagnosis of computers for faster resolution response</li>
                            <li>Increased efficiency and granularity with software updates and security patches</li>
                            <li>Reduced employee downtime with smooth onboarding and rollout</li>
                            <li>Supported continuous and uninterrupted customer service for banking transactions</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Because of new efficiencies enabled by the Intel vPro platform, the IT team loses less time
                            on operational matters. This gives the team more time to focus on responsibilities as well
                            as explore new projects and solutions that generate value for the organization. A potential
                            benefit, suggested by research,<sup>2</sup><br>
                            is that Caja Huancayo may reduce additional IT hires to help manage the PC fleet.</p>
                        <p>In-branch employees now work more effectively with less downtime because of the modern
                            hardware benefits of quicker IT response times, easier issue resolution, and other
                            productivity improvements; research shows that employees can save up to two hours per month
                            when using Intel vPro platform-based devices.<sup>2</sup><br>
                            This supported Caja Huancayo in upholding its reputation for customer service by allowing
                            employees to be more productive, efficient, and available for customers.</p>
                        <p>Caja Huancayo also saved money as a result of reduced technician travel time and device
                            repair shipping expenses. The organization simultaneously decreased the CO2 emissions that
                            occur as related to those activities, thanks to the management commands included in Intel
                            AMT.</p>
                        <p>The institution also saw cost savings from decreased company-wide energy consumption after
                            the activation. Intel AMT features a flexible remote scheduling function that powers down
                            systems not in use and wakes them before the workday begins. By using remote management to
                            handle updates, diagnostics, and patches during off-hours, Caja Huancayo conserved money and
                            energy as a bonus outcome to the original project.</p>
                        <p>Using the Intel EMA console to activate Intel AMT proved the value of the Intel vPro platform
                            for Caja Huancayo. As a result, Mendoza Caballero and his team have made the Intel vPro
                            platform part of the device criteria for the upcoming organization-wide PC refresh. This
                            decision will help standardize their fleet with high-performance technology.</p>

                            <li><strong>Simplicity</strong> With IT stretched to meet current performance demands, solution deployment needed to be efficient.</li>
                            <li><strong>Device Visibility</strong> IT needed a centralized view of the device fleet, including hardware components and technical documentation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Remote Support</strong> The team needed to provide virtual IT servicing support vs. losing time and expenses deploying on-site technicians.</li>
                            <li><strong>Economic Sensitivity</strong> Limited budget was available to invest in implementing an integrated solution for rented equipment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Minimal Disruption</strong> The organization required flexibility to schedule updates outside business hours.</li>
                        </ul>
