                                        <p class="V_pv ">Most home laptops come in a clamshell form factor, where a
                                            screen flips up to reveal a keyboard and a trackpad. This popular form
                                            factor protects your laptop’s screen when closed, and it typically leaves
                                            enough room for comfortable typing and mouse use whether sitting at a desk
                                            or on a couch.</p>

                                                2-in-1</a>, allows owners to either detach the keyboard or fold it
                                            behind the screen, at which point they treat the laptop’s screen like a
                                            stand-alone touchscreen tablet. 2-in-1s offer the best of both worlds—the
                                            performance of a PC and the fun of a tablet—in one sleek device.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv ">Unlike other laptop categories, home laptops don’t necessarily
                                            have to be the thinnest, smallest, and lightest, especially if you plan to
                                            primarily use your laptop on a desk or a table. Larger home laptops can fit
                                            more keys on their keyboards, like a 10-key pad, which can be useful for
                                            bank statements and other personal projects. They can also include bigger
                                            screens, additional ports, optical (DVD or CD) drives, and more gaming
                                            potential, all of which we’ll cover later in this article.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv ">Still, if you prefer to rest your laptop on your lap or you
                                            like the option of tucking your home laptop into a bag and using it at a
                                            cafe, you may want to opt for a smaller, lighter form factor. You can still

                                        <p class="V_pv ">The size of a laptop’s screen will directly influence its
                                            weight and price. Laptops are typically categorized in stores and online by
                                            the size of their screens. Common screen sizes for laptops usually start at
                                            11 inches and continue up to 17 inches.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">A good home laptop should support a big enough screen to
                                            accommodate your most intensive uses. Thankfully, newer laptop screens
                                            support high resolutions, which you need to pack more windows and apps onto
                                            a single screen. If you imagine only using a laptop for basic tasks, such as
                                            web browsing, email, and word processing, a 13-inch screen could be a great
                                            choice.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">One way to get the best of all worlds is to set up an external
                                            monitor at your home laptop’s ideal desk or table. By connecting an external
                                            monitor to your home laptop, you’ll be able to view and manage more apps and
                                            windows across all visible screens. When you don’t need as much screen real
                                            estate and want to take your laptop to another room or on the go, simply
                                            disconnect the external monitor, just like you’d disconnect an AC power

                                            laptop is no easy task for manufacturers. How long a laptop’s battery will
                                            last depends on what you’re using the PC for; it’s best to look at
                                            manufacturers’ specs as a general guideline.

                                            or the brighter its screen is set, the less battery life it will provide.
                                            Smaller laptops use lower-voltage processors designed specifically to offer
                                            better battery life. Typically, midsized to larger laptops will offer
                                            between four and six hours on a full charge, while ultraportable models can
                                            go for as long as 10 hours. When shopping for laptops, look at
                                            manufacturers’ websites for battery life estimates or search for and read
                                            online reviews for the devices you’re interested in.

                                                screens mean lower prices. Screen-specific features, such as touchscreen

                                                can raise a laptop’s price as well, so you may be able to get a larger

                                                options are smaller, faster, and more durable, so they typically cost
                                                more. Some laptops offer a combination of a small SSD and a larger HDD

                                            laptop, but exactly how much? This depends on the types of games you’re
                                            playing and the services you might access them from.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv ">The biggest gaming specs to look for on a home laptop are its
                                            central processing unit (CPU) and its graphics processing unit (GPU), also
                                            known as a graphics card. If you want to play modern 3D games on your home
                                            laptop, its CPU should have a clock speed of no less than 2 GHz, while its
                                            GPU can vary based on the types of games you want to play. Laptop-specific
                                            GPUs can do a lot with a little; so long as you have a GPU in your home
                                            laptop at all, you’ll get better performance than home laptops that skip the
                                            GPU. Faster and more powerful laptop GPUs cost more than entry-level GPUs as
                                            well.

                                        <p class="V_pv ">If you want to play games on less powerful home laptops, you
                                            have a few options. Thousands of popular games are optimized for nongaming
                                            laptops, particularly the ones that look like retro and arcade classics of
                                            the 1980s and ’90s. And if you have a strong internet connection, you can
                                            play powerful games on cheaper laptops via “cloud gaming” services. These
                                            render video games on much more powerful computers then stream the results
                                            to your home laptop.
