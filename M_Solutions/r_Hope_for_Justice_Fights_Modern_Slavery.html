                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">A Human Rights Tragedy of the 21st Century</h2>
                        <p>In today’s modern world, most people see slavery as a historical phenomenon. While the media
                            occasionally covers stories about victims, we tend to think of slavery and human trafficking
                            as tragedies whose time has passed. </p>
                        <p>Not so. Most people today would be shocked to know that there are more than 50 million human
                            beings trapped in slavery today, more than at any point in history.1 Slavery in the 21st
                            century is a crime that takes many forms, including sexual exploitation (primarily of women
                            and children), forced labor, domestic servitude, criminal exploitation, organ harvesting,
                            and forced marriage. It also includes human trafficking and smuggling, which often involves
                            recruiting individuals through threats, force, fraud, coercion, or deception on the part of
                            criminals in positions of power. </p>
                        <p>Standing in opposition to these crimes are groups such as <a href="">Hope for Justice</a>, a
                            non-governmental organization working to end modern slavery and human trafficking and
                            protect the rights of victims and survivors. Founded in 2008, Hope for Justice works to
                            prevent human trafficking; to investigate and identify cases and accompany survivors as they
                            claim their rights to justice, protection, and redress; and to partner with survivors’ and
                            other civil society organizations, companies, and governments to address the root causes of
                            people’s vulnerability to modern slavery.</p>

                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Data as a Tool for Justice</h2>
                        <p>In combating modern slavery, data plays a role that is hard to overstate. Imitating
                            legitimate businesses, criminal organizations that profit from human exploitation are
                            skilled at using data and technology to advance their efforts. In response, institutions and
                            organizations like Hope for Justice are looking to harness technology and data to close the
                            technology gap, utilizing it as a tool for good. </p>
                        <p>Globally, organizations working on cases of human trafficking have collected large pools of
                            valuable data on both victims of slavery and perpetrators, as well as contextual information
                            relating to emerging patterns and trends. </p>
                        <p>Victim data is incredibly sensitive and invariably includes personally identifiable
                            information, while data on perpetrators may include the financial flows and organizational
                            structures of criminal enterprises. All of this data is crucial information towards
                            effective investigation and mitigation. However, if this sensitive data is leaked via
                            mismanagement, rogue actors, or cyber threats, it can result in dire consequences for
                            victims, compromise investigations, and hinder prosecutions. As a result, the safest
                            approach for each organization has been to keep all information private, with little or no
                            data exposed to any other actor. However, these relatively strict data practices can also
                            slow or hinder effective investigations and interventions, especially where there are
                            concerns for the safety of an individual. To date, anti-trafficking forces have lacked the
                            tools to overcome the fears around data privacy and securely share data to extract
                            information crucial to the fight for human dignity.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Confidential Computing</h2>
                        <p>Intel and Edgeless Systems enabled Hope for Justice to take advantage of <a
                                href="">Confidential
                                Computing</a>—a technology that enables sensitive data to be processed confidentially,
                            out of
                            view from unauthorized software or system administrators.</p>
                        <p>Confidential Computing enables encrypted data to be processed in memory while lowering the
                            risk of exposing it to the rest of the system, thereby reducing the likelihood that
                            sensitive data will be compromised. In addition, it provides a higher degree of control and
                            transparency for users in multi-tenant environments where data can be isolated from other
                            privileged portions of the system stack.</p>
                        <p>With its focus on securing data and code during processing, Confidential Computing relies on
                            hardware- based controls such as the Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) enabled by <a
                                href="">Intel®
                                Software Guard Extensions</a> (Intel® SGX) enclaves. Intel SGX helps provide protection
                            for
                            applications and data independent of the operating system or hardware configuration. This
                            enables multiple organizations to collaborate on shared analyses and validate algorithms
                            while shielding their confidential information or regulated data from the other parties.
                            Intel SGX:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Helps protect against software attacks, even when other elements of the stack are
                                compromised.</li>
                            <li>Helps increase protection for secret content (personally identifiable information and
                                data, sensitive legal information, keys, etc.).</li>
                            <li>Provides options for hardware-based attestation to validate code and signatures.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Confidential Computing lies at the heart of the Intel-Edgeless Systems-Hope for Justice
                            collaboration.</p>
                            <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">The Intel-Edgeless Systems-Hope for Justice Project</h2>
                        <p>Intel, Edgeless Systems, and Hope for Justice built the Private Data Exchange (PDEx), a powerful application to be offered to the global movement to end human trafficking. PDEx enables the various organizations working against slavery to confidentially pool data related to individual cases. After data from these groups is uploaded, the application aggregates and analyzes it, then notifies appropriate agencies when relevant data matches are uncovered.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Challenge</h2>
                        <p>Swedish municipalities can benefit from a digital assistant that helps government workers
                            increase efficiency and mitigate the current labor shortage in the public sector. AI
                            Sweden’s work also enables national collaboration around a shared solution with long-term
                            value for government entities.</p>

                            Officer, Kungsbacka Municipality.</i>
                        <p>To be successful, a generative AI assistant must provide specific and relevant answers to
                            users’ natural language queries. AI Sweden’s prototype system involves a RAG approach that
                            uses staff-annotated content to increase the quality and validity of the digital assistant’s
                            responses.</p>
                        <P>Before the solution can help public organizations explore the value of resource sharing, AI
                            Sweden must ensure that security measures adhere to local and European regulations like the
                            European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Therefore, the virtual
                            assistant’s front- and back-end technologies depend on end-to-end encryption.</P>

                            control. <a href=""
                                style="color: #0068B5; text-decoration: underline  dashed !important;text-underline-offset: .3rem !important;">Intel®
                                Trust Domain Extensions</a> (Intel® TDX) provide added layers of confidential
                            computing protection through hardware-level isolation within virtual machines (VM) to
                            protect documents, data, and applications from unauthorized access.</P>
                        <p>If a municipality requires additional security measures, server infrastructure can adjust to
                            meet these needs. With compliant security, even an administrator cannot access personal
                            healthcare information passed through the system, ensuring privacy per European, national,
                            and local regulations.</p>
                        <p>Development support from Intel helps AI Sweden maximize hardware capabilities, make
                            software-based adjustments, and assist with preliminary testing on evaluation datasets. The
                            process will help optimize the system to accommodate an increasing number of users over
                            time.</p>
                        <p>With the assistance of Intel® components and expertise, the proof-of-concept AI assistant can
                            now handle tasks like creating documents, improving written language, or filling out
                            applications. Because municipalities employ a diverse workforce, and not all are fluent in
                            Swedish, the solution also manages content and queries in English. Plans include support for
                            more languages.</p>

                            <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left me-4" style="font-size: 100px; color: #E5E6E6;"></i><i>“In
                                our early testing, generative AI helped public employees find relevant information in a
                                fraction of the time required by a manual, legacy approach. Given the current shortage
                                of skilled workers, our prototype virtual assistant can save existing employees’ time so
                                they can stay focused on job activities that matter most.” —Jonatan Permert</i>
                        </div>
                        <p>AI Sweden and the associated municipalities will scope multiple use cases as the
                            proof-of-concept system demonstrates its potential. For example, if a government official
                            needs to make a critical decision, the digital assistant can help summarize the most
                            relevant background information.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Results</h2>
                        <p>While the prototype digital assistant remains under development, the initial results show
                            great promise. Early testing and anecdotal feedback indicate the solution remains on track
                            to meet its goals. Government employees testing the system found benefits like time savings
                            and more accurate results with text-related tasks.</p>
                        <p>A worker shortage in Sweden can make a digital assistant especially valuable to the country.
                            For example, with generative AI taking over time-consuming and repetitive tasks in
                            government facilities, employees can allocate more time to job activities that require human
                            expertise and interaction.</p>
                        <p>The digital assistant can also adapt to support smaller public organizations with fewer
                            resources, smaller budgets, and less specialized knowledge. AI Sweden plans to expand the
                            testing process to a thousand users in the near future. Over time, the digital assistant
                            could inspire other nations seeking to tap AI’s potential in government settings.</p>
                        <p>The virtual assistant supports Sweden’s goals of maintaining digital sovereignty and making
                            technology investments that could make public employees’ jobs easier and more efficient. The
                            solution also supports Sweden’s democratic ideals for transparency, integrity, and
                            opportunity for greater representation.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Key Takeaways</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A collaboration between AI Sweden and governmental municipalities led to a prototype
                                digital assistant that can assist government staff with repetitive tasks, allowing them
                                to focus on the more interpersonal aspects of their jobs.</li>
                            <li>Intel Xeon processors and Intel Gaudi 2 accelerators underlie the prototype’s
                                architecture and provide the needed security features, scalability, and performance.
                            </li>
                            <li>Making RAG solutions valuable to users requires significant fine-tuning. With the help
                                of staff-annotated content, the digital assistant can respond to queries with more
                                applicable and accurate information.</li>
                            <li>AI Sweden designed the prototype to meet European data privacy requirements like GDPR
                                and Sweden’s countrywide mandates. A combination of secure memory enclaves, encrypted
                                storage, and Intel TDX provided a foundation for multi-layered security.</li>
                            <li>AI Sweden’s experience building and testing the proof-of-concept system can serve as a
                                template for other countries wishing to implement a similar solution.</li>
