                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4" id="key1">Understand Predictive Maintenance (PdM) Benefits</h3>
                        <p>Using AI for a predictive maintenance strategy can help your factory avoid costly issues resulting from equipment failure and unplanned downtime, including lost productivity, repair costs, and missed customer delivery times and expectations.</p>
                        <p>Predictive maintenance provides a cost-effective alternative to the expensive run-to-failure mentality prevalent at companies using older legacy systems. It also improves upon outdated, labor-intensive preventative maintenance approaches, in which maintenance is performed in rigid, fixed increments.</p>
                        <p>A data-driven approach, by contrast, lets you intervene before costly downtime occurs. Through <a href="../rushita_Solutions/k_solutions_in_Viewall_Software-Defined-Infrastructure-Manufacturers.html" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline">modern software-defined plant floor infrastructure</a>, operational data is collected from multiple failure points on physical equipment throughout the factory—often production equipment, engines, and other high-value assets.</p>
                        <p>Car manufacturers, for example, can use sensor data to monitor the condition of welding guns, which are prone to overheating. Analytics are used to forecast future failures based on the machine’s working condition, triggering alerts as thresholds are approached.</p>
                        <p>With an AI-enabled predictive maintenance strategy, your organization can:&nbsp;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Maximize uptime</strong> by adopting a predictive approach. Sensor data provides advance notice of potential failures, driving more effective decision-making and expediting repairs. You can plan ahead to minimize the impact of machine failure on operations, schedule maintenance proactively to avoid lengthy disruptions to production, and divert loads to other equipment while machines are being serviced.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Drive operational efficiencies</strong> by anticipating when equipment is going to fail. Having equipment up and running efficiently is the core driver of production and profit margins, allowing you to maximize overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), hit key performance indicators (KPIs), and optimize return on investment (ROI).</li>
                                <li><strong>Achieve product quality consistency</strong> by using historical data to predict wear and tear on critical components. You can order maintenance when anomalies are predicted and keep equipment within ideal parameters to achieve close-to-zero defect rates.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Closely related is AI-based machine condition monitoring, a similar Industry 4.0 technique that allows you to simulate operational outcomes with a digital twin, detect anomalies that foretell catastrophic failures, detect product defects, and use computer vision to monitor workers to meet safety compliance regulations.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>Now that you know some of the benefits of intelligent detection in the factory, you are ready to start planning your implementation. Here are the steps you should take to coordinate a successful predictive maintenance deployment.</p>

                       

                       
                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Evaluate Your Risk Level</h3>
                        <p>The first step is to assess your organization’s risk level. Manufacturers are exposed to myriad risks that predictive maintenance and AI-enabled machine condition monitoring help mitigate, from equipment failure and defects to safety and compliance. Compiling a report on potential risks will allow you to determine if an AI solution is worth the upfront investment.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Internal risk assessment</strong> should be conducted to gain insight into your operational risks. Some important data points to consider include:
                        
                            <ul>
                                <li>Hazard analyses</li>
                                <li>Machine downtime logs</li>
                                <li>Product quality surveys</li>
                                <li>Safety incident reviews</li>
                                <li>Records and historical data on process deviation</li>
                                <li>Defect rates</li>
                                <li>Compliance issues</li>
                                <li>ISO certification statuses</li>
                            </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>External risk assessment</strong> and research into the financial implications of unexpected downtime should also be conducted. Research how production stoppage can result in supply-chain bottlenecks and cause commodity price fluctuations, and conduct surveys on how downtime impacts customer satisfaction. AI solutions can help mitigate your business risks by keeping operations running smoothly.<br>
                            <br>
                            The specific risks your organization is exposed to will vary by subsector:</li>
                            <li style="list-style-type:none">
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Discrete manufacturers</strong>, such as automotive, appliance, and electronics makers, are more susceptible to issues with quality loss and supply chain disruptions due to machine failure.</li>
                                <li><strong>Process manufacturers</strong>, including pharmaceutical and food and beverage companies, are more vulnerable to problems pertaining to formula errors, regulatory compliance, and process control.</li>
                            </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You should also rely on external research, including competitive analysis and industry reports, to compare digital transformations in plants or factories similar to your own. For example, you can read a success story on how <a href="../rushita_Solutions/k_solutions_in_Viewall_Predictive-Maintenance-BMW-Group.html" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline">BMW used Industry 4.0 solutions to automate and enhance critical quality control processes in their factories</a>.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Implement Your AI Solution</h3>
                        <p>The next step is to deploy AI capabilities throughout your factory so that you can monitor your equipment. This requires both physically installing AI-capable technology to collect data on each piece of equipment and deploying an AI algorithm to analyze collected data in real time to identify and prevent maintenance, compliance, and productivity-related issues.</p>
                        <p>Here’s a more detailed summary of what is involved in deploying an AI solution in your factory:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Install </strong>AI-capable technology in equipment to collect operational data and failure history and define machine-specific characteristics. Operational data provides the basis for predictive maintenance, specifically a machine’s normal functioning data and error data. Sensors are often used to collect this data. For example, if a hydraulic pump is being monitored, sensors can capture vibration rates, oil pressure, speed of fluid, and other relevant parameters. Alternatively, if the machine is part of a software-defined control (SDC) system, telemetry agents are installed to capture the machine’s characteristics in real time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prepare </strong>your machine data at the edge or in the cloud. A database is used to store the raw data for analysis. A data scientist will preprocess the data to transform it into a suitable format for the algorithm. The preprocessing step improves data accuracy and allows the algorithm to process the data efficiently.</li>
                            <li><strong>Train </strong>your AI algorithm on preprocessed data to create a model specific to the machine’s operational data. A data scientist will identify the appropriate algorithm to use based on the nature of the data and key performance indicators such as latency, the size of the model, and accuracy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Deploy </strong>trained AI models<strong> </strong>on <a href="../rushita_Solutions/k_solutions_in_Viewall_Predictive-Maintenance-AI_Edge-Devices.html" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline">edge devices</a>&nbsp;or on a central server that collects streaming data from various machines to make predictions collectively. The best option for your organization will depend on your aforementioned risk level. Operations that require real-time predictions should deploy the model on edge devices, while those with more leeway in predicting failures can use a central server.<br>
                            <br>
                            However, there are tradeoffs to consider. Reading data in real time on edge devices may necessitate using a smaller model, which could be less accurate than a large model, leading to variations in the forecasts.<br>
                            <br>
                            Edge devices with AI acceleration are recommended for edge use cases. <a href="../Product/B18openvino.html" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline">OpenVINO™ toolkit</a>, an open-source toolkit for optimizing and deploying AI models, allows you to run AI applications at the edge with improved efficiency.<br>
