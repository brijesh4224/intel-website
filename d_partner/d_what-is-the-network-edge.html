                        <p></p>
                        <p>Organizations need agile, scalable networks to meet the increasing demands of new and
                            evolving use cases—from streaming media to industrial robots to intelligent traffic
                            management—to deliver the highest-level quality of service. Pushing compute to the network
                            edge, closer to where data is created and consumed, provides the actionable insights you
                            need for monetization opportunities and operational savings.</p>
                        <p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">The Value of an Agile Network Edge</h2>
                        <p>Service providers face the daunting tasks of delivering competitive, differentiated services.
                            Today’s data-intensive and latency-sensitive applications demand greater performance. And
                            when it comes to the innovative services of tomorrow, service providers need to adapt
                            quickly to evolving standards.
                        </p>
                        <p>Existing networks that primarily rely on a consolidated cloud computing and data storage
                            model or on fixed function physical infrastructure are challenged to deliver the
                            cost-effective near-real-time responsiveness required by existing use cases. Over the next
                            few years, these networks will also need to improve scalability to support the rapidly
                            growing number of sensors and devices, estimated to reach 50 billion by 20221, and data
                            volumes, predicted to grow to 175 zettabytes by 2025
                        </p>
                        <p>To respond to customer expectations while controlling capital investment and operational
                            cost, network infrastructures need to be transformed to be agile, scalable, and intelligent.
                            Upgraded infrastructure can adjust to meet variable system demands—providing lower latency,
                            improved throughput, and greater reliability—and enable capitalization of every data point
                            in the network, leading to new revenue stream opportunities and insights.</p>
                        <p>Essential to this modernized infrastructure is combining the power of edge computing with
                            cloud-ready software infrastructure. Optimizing workload placement on shared physical
                            resources can help offer higher returns.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Benefits of Computing at the Network Edge</h2>
                        <p>Placing compute at the network edge makes it possible to intelligently manage workload
                            placement and provides key operational benefits:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Increased speed and lower latency.</b>Moving data processing and analysis to the edge
                                helps speed system response, enabling faster transactions and better experiences that
                                could be vital in near-real-time applications.</li>
                            <li><b>Improved network traffic management.</b>Minimizing the amount of data sent over the
                                network to the cloud can reduce the bandwidth and costs of transmitting and storing
                                large volumes of data.</li>
                            <li><b>Greater reliability.</b>The amount of data that networks can transmit at one time is
                                limited. For locations with subpar internet connectivity, being able to store and
                                process data at the edge improves reliability when the cloud connection is disrupted.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Enhanced security features.</b>An edge computing solution may help increase data
                                security by limiting the transmission of data over the internet. In healthcare, for
                                example, there may even be local or regional requirements to limit the storage or
                                transmission of personal data.</li>
                            <li><b>Agility and scalability.</b>With the ability to distribute computing strategically
                                across the network, companies can ensure applications settle in the place of highest
                                value and make the best use of their resources. This opens up a range of opportunities
                                such as establishing new services, targeting service delivery between localized markets,
                                or expanding capacity without the need to open a new data center.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">Considerations for the Network Edge</h2>
                        <p>The network edge sits within your network just outside the network core. It includes
                            converging locations such as regional data centers, next generation central offices (NGCOs),
                            fixed wireline access points, wireless access base stations, and radio access networks
                            (RANs). The network edge can also include on-premises locations, such as universal customer
                            premises equipment (uCPE) devices where multiple workloads such as <a
                                href="">software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN)</a> and enterprise applications can
                            be hosted in a single edge-computing device.</p>
                        <p>Transformation of the network edge is about system optimization and enabling increased
                            control over traffic management including over how and where to process and transmit data at
                            the data-packet level.</p>
                        <p>Service providers have already adopted software-defined networking (SDN) and network
                            functions virtualization (NFV) to bring flexibility into their networks, but this approach
                            can be extended further. Adopting cloud-like management practices and implementing a
                            software-defined edge can bring increased operational agility and resource efficiency.</p>
                        <p>Combining regional fixed and mobile network functions into a new central office, deploying
                            private wireless networks, or ensuring secure enterprise universal customer premises
                            equipment (uCPE) solutions will take a careful balance of performance and agility.</p>
