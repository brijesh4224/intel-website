                                From healthcare and financial services to government and tech, organizations handling regulated data must implement rigorous security measures to protect the sensitive and confidential data they store, access, and work with every day. This requires more-advanced security technologies that can help reduce the risk of exposure, keep organizations in compliance with consumer privacy laws and regulations, and layer in security protections at the hardware level up through the operating system, software components, applications, and the cloud.</h4>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Mitigating Sensitive Data Exposure in Today’s Security Landscape</h3>
                        <p>From sophisticated cyber threats to unintentional data exposure and large fines to legal actions, the stakes are high for protecting and securing your sensitive data. However, knowing what proactive measures you should take, navigating through today’s privacy-enhancing technologies, and determining which tech will best fit your unique data and compliance requirements is complex. In the end, the process of reducing your organization’s risk of sensitive data exposure may leave you with more questions than answers.</p>
                        <p>To help make your efforts simpler and easier, let’s walk through some key steps to consider when mitigating your sensitive data exposure risk.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Know the Consequences of Sensitive Data Exposure for Your Organization</h3>
                        <p>Fines, legal and regulatory repercussions, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust—the consequences of sensitive data exposure can be significant and far reaching for organizations.</p>
                        <p>Having a deep understanding of your industry’s existing laws and regulations is a critical first step to avoiding these and more-disastrous consequences. Additionally, you can use this&nbsp;knowledge to help guide your choice of privacy-enhancing technology and inform the creation of your data security program.</p>
                        <p>Security standards vary from industry to industry and change based on the location in which they were created. For example, US-based businesses operating within the healthcare industry must comply with the <a href="#" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</a>, while financial services organizations are required to follow the <a href="#" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline">Sarbanes-Oxley Act</a>.</p>
                        <p>Businesses that interact with European citizens or organizations based in the European Union must comply with regulations as well, such as the <a href="#" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline">EU Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="#" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Consider Your Privacy-Enhancing Technology Options</h3>
                        <p>You may have already started investigating privacy-enhancing technologies and found the number of available options overwhelming.</p>
                        <p>To help you with your evaluation, we suggest first focusing on your organization’s unique criteria for enhancing your data protection and mitigating risk. Then, when you begin examining types of data security, you can be prepared to look at your options through the lens of your organization’s needs rather than only seeing a technology’s features and benefits.</p>
                        <p>Here are some of the most common data security types you’ll likely encounter during your research.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Secure multiparty computing</li>
                            <li>Data tokenization</li>
                            <li>Homomorphic encryption</li>
                            <li>Differential privacy</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="my-4">While these data protection technologies are effective in helping to keep data private, they can also surface new challenges, including the need to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Perform multiple transformations on data, which adds latency and complexity and could result in a loss of data fidelity.</li>
                            <li>Restructure a substantial amount of the data or recode applications with new tools or techniques.</li>
                            <li>Add costly specialized hardware or accelerators to address the significant compute or network overhead these technologies require.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Choose Confidential Computing to Reduce Your Risk of Sensitive Data Exposure</h3>
                        <p>A superior alternative to these options is <a href="../rushita_Solutions/k_solutions_Topics_Viewall_Confidential-Computing-Solutions.html" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline">confidential computing</a>, which enhances the protection of sensitive data without the need to transform it or use unusual coding or tools.
