                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Challenge</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Citi FX Markets Quantitative Analysis (FX MQA) team is tasked with providing Citi FX
                                traders with real-time valuations of FX options.</li>
                            <li>Armed with this information, FX traders can hedge their position giving Citi a
                                competitive edge in the FX market segment.</li>
                            <li>To further improve risk calculation time, Citi’s FX MQA team needed a technical solution
                                to accelerate the compute-intensive calculations involved in pricing FX options.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Solution</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Citi and Intel collaborated on an initial proof of concept (PoC) to evaluate the
                                performance impact of integrating field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) into two of
                                Citi’s primary FX pricing engines.</li>
                            <li>The PoC showed that FPGA-based acceleration provides the performance needed to enable
                                Citi traders to assess risk across large, complex option portfolios and react quickly to
                                changes in market conditions.</li>
                            <li>Through high-level design tools and languages, such as OpenCL, the FX MQA team can
                                deploy algorithms on an FPGA without having to employ specialist PGA developers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Result</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The FPGA-based system is now in production enabling Citi FX traders to compute risks
                                instantly and access scarce liquidity to hedge their positions on FX options.</li>
                            <li>The use of standard servers, processors, acceleration cards, and tools provide a
                                platform that is scalable and extensible to meet growing compute needs.</li>
                            <li>Citi’s improved risk application allows it to continue to sharpen its competitive edge
                                in the FX market segment.</li>

                        </h2>
                        <p>The Citi FX Markets Quantitative Analysis (FX MQA) team supports the bank’s FX Options
                            trading desk in calculating the valuations and risks of FX options. Understanding the risks
                            of a large portfolio of complex options enables Citi’s FX traders to hedge their position.
                            As such, more accurate and up-to-date calculation of risk leads to a competitive advantage
                            for the bank.</p>
                        <p>To further strengthen Citi’s competitive position in the FX market segment and improve
                            real-time risk application, the FX MQA team sought a technical solution to accelerate the
                            compute-intensive calculations involved in pricing FX options.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Solution Details</h2>
                        <p>The FX MQA team wanted to deploy field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) in a way that
                            utilized standard hardware in the form of servers and plug-in accelerator cards. It also
                            wanted to standardize programming languages to ease integration.</p>
                        <p>Citi partnered with Intel to evaluate two of its primary pricing engines on FPGAs. These
                            engines were a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) solver used to price barrier options, and
                            a Vanilla Pricer used to price vanilla options.</p>
                        <p>For the PDE solver, Citi developed a specification, which was then implemented by Intel. This
                            part of the project was implemented over two phases. The first comprised a standard
                            implementation of a PDE solver and the second added bespoke features for Citi. To learn the
                            development flow and to be sure that it could become self-sufficient in creating and
                            maintaining its own algorithms on the FPGA, the FX MQA team developed the Vanilla Pricer
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>The use of high-level programming for FPGAs was critical for Citi to be effective at using
                            the technology. OpenCL was used as the programming language, which provides a C/C++ based
                            entry method that is more familiar to software developers than traditional Register Transfer
                            Level (RTL) methods. Coupled with the <a href="../dhruvin_developer-tools/Development-Tools/ds_FGPA-Development-Tools.html">Intel® FPGA Acceleration Stack</a>, this
                            high-level
                            programming provided a flow that abstracts all the lower-level FPGA details, such as PCIe
                            and memory interfacing, assignments, and timing closure. This flow enables the team to
                            successfully implement the algorithms with limited prior knowledge of FPGA development.</p>
                        <p>Daan Posthuma from the FX MQA team commented: “The <a href="">Intel FPGA development
                                tools</a> are easy to use. As OpenCL is so familiar to C++, it was straightforward to
                            port our code to FPGAs and gain significant speed-ups.”</p>
                        <p>In parallel with the programming efforts of the FX MQA team, which took place in London, the
                            Low Latency team at Citi assessed the full acceleration stack in the Citi Technology
                            Infrastructure organization in New York.</p>
                        <p>The hardware solution comprised a Dell R740 dual-socket server fitted with <a href="">Intel®
                                Xeon® Gold
                                6254 processors</a> and three <a href="">Intel® Programmable Acceleration Cards with
                                Intel® Arria® 10 FPGAs</a>
                            (Intel® PACs with Intel Arria 10 FPGAs). The team was focused on an acceleration solution
                            that could be utilized by both high-performance compute and low-latency electronic trading
                            applications. The acceleration stack was selected to provide high CPU frequency speed and
                            number of cores, with an optimized BIOS and operating system (OS) to reduce latency and
                            jitter.</p>
                        <p>Jeremy York, Head of Low Latency Infrastructure at Citi said: “This allowed Citi to reduce
                            footprint and allow applications to run in the same host as the acceleration cards, where
                            the computation part of the algorithm is offloaded from the CPU.”</p>

                        <p>The PoC proved to be successful and is now running in production, with both the PDE and
                            Vanilla Pricer exceeding performance goals. The use of FPGAs has enabled Citi to compute its
                            risks instantly and, in fast-moving markets, access scarce liquidity to hedge its positions.
                            By working with Intel, Citi has integrated the Intel PACs and associated frameworks into its
                            existing production environments and software platforms. The FX MQA team has proven that it
                            can efficiently develop algorithms in FPGAs using high-level languages and tool flows.</p>
                        <p>Ben Nasatyr, head of the FX MQA team, commented: “Intel FPGAs are a key part of this work,
                            but their performance benefits would have remained inaccessible to my team without a
                            high-level language like OpenCL. The support and partnership we have received from Intel
                            throughout has been the key to making this project a success and has given us confidence
                            that, in the future, we can easily apply the same acceleration techniques to other models
                            and algorithms.”</p>
                        <p>With the current pricers now in deployment, Citi is considering which other algorithms could
                            gain from FPGA acceleration. An obvious next step for Citi is Monte Carlo simulation. The
                            team is now investigating this model with some very promising early results showing a
                            significant acceleration for path generation compared with previous implementations.</p>
