                        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                        <p><a href="">Royal Enfield </a>has been making motorcycles continuously since 1901, longer than
                            any other
                            company. Recently, the Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 won India’s most prestigious
                            two-wheeler award, the Indian Motorcycle of the Year (IMOTY) award.</p>
                        <p>High performance computing (HPC) with workstations, specifically computer-aided engineering
                            (CAE), has been a critical part of motorcycle design work at Royal Enfield for the better
                            part of two decades. Their engineers utilized workstations and are supported by a dedicated
                            but small IT team.</p>
                        <p>Contemplating a move to HPC meant facing a myriad of software and hardware purchases, and
                            management of the same. The effort had long been estimated to be far too much for a
                            workstation-based CAE team to consider given the setup and administrative burden of typical
                            HPC systems and appliances.</p>
                        <h2>Challenge</h2>
                        <p>Finite-element (FE) models for motorcycle designs require extensive processing for doing
                            structural analysis. Royal Enfield utilizes Altair OptiStruct™ for non-linear implicit FE
                            analysis, and Altair Radioss™ for explicit FE analysis.</p>
                        <p>Analysis time on workstations, especially for complex dynamic events, had become extremely
                            long. This was severely hampering the ability for Royal Enfield to improve and influence the
                            design of their motorcycles. The negative business implications of not delivering more
                            compute to CAE efforts were substantial.</p>
                        <p>Contemplating a move to HPC meant facing a myriad of software and hardware purchases, and

                        <h2>Result</h2>
                        <p>Facing increased demand for compute cycles, Royal Enfield found the Altair HyperWorks
                            Unlimited to be an outstanding solution. The web-based interfaces for users to submit and
                            review jobs are the same they have used with workstations, so adoption was trivial. The
                            day-to-day work for the IT depart­ment is minimal, as the system is well managed by Altair.
                            The resulting leap in capabilities for Royal Enfield enables signifi­cantly more competitive
                            engineering for their motorcycles.</p>

                        <h2>Royal Enfield CAE Transformed</h2>
                        <p>Royal Enfield has found that this solution is allowing them to move to the “the next level in
                            their simulation journey.” Royal Enfield reported significant increases in productivity (run
                            times 15X faster),1 and much more efficient product develop­ment (number of prototypes
                            decreased by up to 25%).1 Cost savings have been significant as well, from reductions in
                            soft­ware licensing, and removing the need to buy and maintain high-end desktop
                            (workstation) machines.</p>
                        <p>Royal Enfield is doing more simulations today, which is reduc­ing development time, injecting
                            innovation, and helping them develop better products for their customers.</p>
