                        <p class="m_para2">
                            To gain a competitive edge, many of today’s businesses are implementing classical machine
                            learning (ML), a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), across their organization.
                            Classical ML uses models, or algorithms, to analyze massive data sets, identify patterns,
                            and make predictions without human intervention. Organizations use ML-identified patterns
                            and trends to make smarter, faster decisions that can improve business efficiency, improve
                            security, and create new data-driven products and services tailored to customer behaviors.
                            Common ML models include linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines,
                            nearest neighbor similarity search, and decision trees.
                        </p>
                        <p class="m_para2">
                            Classical ML models are often computationally lighter than deep learning neural networks.
                            They rely heavily on the quality of the data they learn from and are considered explainable
                            AI. Explainable AI gives organizations, decision-makers, and data scientists traceable
                            insight into how an algorithm arrived at a specific result. With transparency into how the
                            algorithm works, users can identify potential biases and discover how variables contribute
                            to an outcome. Explainable AI is often required for regulated industries such as financial
                            services and government. The explainable use of AI is also one of six principles that guides
                            Intel’s internal multidisciplinary Responsible AI Advisory Council.
