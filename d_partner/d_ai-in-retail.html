                            <h2 class="d_head d_fw3">The Role of AI in Retail</h2>
                            <p>Nearly all industries are feeling the impact of AI as it evolves and permeates all
                                aspects of
                                business.
                            </p>
                            <p>Today’s retailers are using <a href="">AI technologies</a> in a variety of ways—from
                                personalizing and enhancing the customer experience to <a href="">creating a
                                    frictionless
                                    shopping journey </a> to boosting loss prevention efforts.</p>
                            <p>Today, edge computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and real-time analytics are creating
                                new opportunities. Intel® Edge Controls for Industrial converges these technologies in a
                                cost-effective way, enabling best-in-breed industrial solutions that operate compatibly.
                                Highly portable workloads can run on scalable, off-the-shelf hardware at high
                                performance levels.</p>
                            <p>Rotkäppchen-Mumm, the largest producer of sparkling wine in Germany, is one such retailer
                                using <a href="">AI to elevate the shopping experience</a>. This winery runs real-time
                                dynamic promotional content on digital signs in its stores. The sign content syncs with
                                sales data and retail analytics to ensure a specific product won’t be advertised on
                                screen
                                if it is out of stock or low in inventory. Rotkäppchen-Mumm also uses these digital
                                signs
                                paired with near-field object recognition, RFID tags, and near invisible sensors to
                                automatically display interactive content about bottles of wine placed near the screen.
                            </p>
                            <p>Retailers are also exploring ways AI can help streamline their internal processes, assist
                                employees in repetitive tasks, and unlock new insights for data-driven decision-making.
                                For
                                example, when <a href="">Lee’s Famous Recipe Chicken</a> faced a staffing shortage and
                                wanted to improve its drive-through experience, it turned to a conversational AI-based
                                attendant to greet customers, take orders, and upsell new items. This technology
                                transition
                                resulted in happier customers and a 95 percent order accuracy rate</p>
                            <p>Increasingly, retail businesses are looking at how more-complex types of AI, such as <a
                                    href="">computer vision</a>, deep learning, or <a href="">generative AI</a>, can
                                help
                                them anticipate and respond to customer needs better, as well as differentiate their
                                brand
                                in crowded and competitive spaces.</p>

                            <p>Whether it’s a small boutique or a multinational superstore, retailers work hard to
                                create
                                shopping experiences that are convenient, personalized, and enjoyable. However, these
                                shopping experiences are no longer enough to satisfy today’s tech-savvy, on-the-go
                                customers. These customers now seek out frictionless shopping and checkout
                                experiences—where
                                most, if not all, interactions with the retailer are streamlined via technologies like
                                AI,
                                computer vision, deep learning, sensors, and software solutions to make the shopping

                                as seamless as possible. By automating most of the transactional interactions, employees
                                can
                                focus on helping customers and other high-value tasks.

                                <p class="mb-1">The technologies and solutions used to enable AI in retail vary widely
                                    depending on the business challenge being solved or project being deployed. However,
                                    the technologies most commonly used across AI use cases include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>General-use processors:</b>These processors are created to be used for a
                                        variety of general-purpose workloads, such as web browsing or word processing,
                                        where acceleration may not be required. However, in some cases, FPGAs can be
                                        added to these processors to increase system performance so they can handle AI
                                        workloads.</li>
                                    <li><b>AI processors:</b>These processors are purpose-built to handle
                                        compute-intensive, specialized AI workloads. These processors can include
                                        integrated accelerators to provide extra performance gains.</li>
                                    <li><b>GPUs:</b>Although not always required to perform AI tasks, GPUs are sometimes
                                        added because of their ability to perform parallel processing when training deep
                                        learning models. GPUs can be integrated into CPUs or added as a discrete
                                        product.</li>
                                    <li><b>Cameras, sensors, or other IoT technologies:</b>To enable machines to “see”
                                        computer vision tasks, cameras and sensors are used to gather visual data for
                                        processing.</li>
                                    <li><b>AI software</b>Specialized AI software solutions are essential for writing,
                                        training, and optimizing the AI algorithms used in machine learning, deep
                                        learning, computer vision, and more.</li>
