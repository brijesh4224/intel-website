                            <p>SANTA CLARA, Calif., April 22, 2024 – The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has awarded
                                Intel Foundry Phase Three of its Rapid Assured Microelectronics Prototypes - Commercial
                                (RAMP-C) program. The award was announced through the National Security Technology
                                Accelerator’s (NSTXL) consortium-based Strategic and Spectrum Missions Advanced
                                Resilient Trusted Systems Other Transaction Authority (S2MARTS OTA) program. The third
                                phase of RAMP-C advances the tape-out and testing of early defense industrial base (DIB)
                                product prototypes, signifying a critical milestone for the program that highlights the
                                readiness of Intel 18A process technology, intellectual property (IP) and ecosystem
                                solutions for high-volume manufacturing (HVM).</p>
                            <p>As part of the announcement, RAMP-C customers can begin manufacturing commercial and DIB
                                product prototypes on Intel 18A process technology.</p>
                            <p>“Today marks another significant moment in advancing our collaboration with DoD on this
                                program. We are very excited that for the first time in decades, U.S. government and
                                defense industrial base customers will have access to one of the industry’s leading-edge
                                process technologies at the same time as commercial customers. This milestone reinforces
                                our commitment to making our capabilities, including leading-edge technologies like
                                Intel 18A, available to a wider range of partners, furthering America’s leadership in
                                process technology R&D, advanced manufacturing and microelectronics systems,” said Kapil
                                Wadhera, Intel vice president for Foundry Services and general manager of the Government
                                Engagements and Business Operations Group.</p>
                            <p>The RAMP-C program aims to restore domestic leadership in leading-edge semiconductors by
                                incentivizing the creation of a sustainable, resilient and trusted commercial foundry
                                ecosystem in the United States. The program enables U.S.-based DIB and commercial
                                customers to fabricate leading-edge custom integrated circuits required for critical DoD
                                systems and commercial products.</p>
                            <p>In 2021, Intel was selected to lead the first phase of RAMP-C, which laid the groundwork
                                for Intel’s foundry business by establishing the technology and yield plans, developing
                                IP and ecosystem tools, and preparing customers for test chip tape-outs. Phase Two
                                expanded RAMP-C customers by onboarding Boeing and Northrop Grumman to design, develop
                                and tape-out solutions based on Intel 18A while continuing to ramp the IP and ecosystem
                                solutions. Phase three will open the stage of extensive test chips and multiple
                                commercial and DIB product prototype tape-outs based on Intel 18A and using new IP and
                                ecosystem tools.</p>
                            <p>“RAMP-C is an important project for Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Research
                                and Engineering Microelectronics as it provides access to leading-edge Intel 18A
                                technology onshore, which is critical for the security of U.S. military systems and
                                platforms. Intel Foundry, a performer on the RAMP-C project, has met their milestones
                                and metrics for Phase Two of the project and has recently been awarded funding to start
                                their Phase Three effort. R&E’s program, managed through Navy Crane and executed through
                                an OTA with NSTXL, is ensuring that the DoD stays at the cutting edge of
                                microelectronics technologies while facilitating close collaboration between the defense
                                industrial base and commercial companies. RAMP-C intends to demonstrate prototype
                                production of Intel 18A chips in 2025 to deliver unprecedented processing performance
                                for the DoD,” said Dr. Dev Shenoy, secretary of defense for Research and Engineering,
                                principal director for Microelectronics.</p>
                            <p><strong>Intel’s Role in RAMP-C</strong></p>
                            <p>Under RAMP-C, Intel Foundry has collaborated with industry leaders, including Microsoft,
                                Nvidia, IBM, Cadence, Synopsys, Boeing, Northrop Grumman and others, to support the
                                commercial and U.S. government’s needs for designing and manufacturing integrated
                                circuits by establishing and demonstrating a semiconductor IP ecosystem to develop and
                                fabricate test chips on Intel 18A, the company's leading process technology. Intel
                                Foundry also established a U.S. Military, Aerospace and Government (USMAG) Alliance
                                comprising ecosystem partners across electronic design automation (EDA), IP and design
                                service providers to work with DIB customers for delivering the functional and
                                operational security required by USMAG applications with Intel foundry technology and
                                offerings.</p>
