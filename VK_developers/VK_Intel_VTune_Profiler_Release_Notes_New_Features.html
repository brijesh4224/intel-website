                                    For some hardware-based analysis types, particularly Memory Access and
                                    Microarchitecture Exploration, VTune may cause a kernel panic on systems with Fedora
                                    distributions running Linux kernel version 5.17 or later. This has been fixed for
                                    the upcoming release. To work around this problem, unload the VTune sep driver by
                                    running:
                                </p>

                                        This will prevent VTune from using the problematic driver and use Linux Perf
                                        instead.

                                    fixed in a future release. The problem was reported on SLES15 SP4 but could happen

                                    To collect data about time-intensive running regions of the target, Intel® VTune™
                                    Profiler interrupts the execution of target threads and attributes the time to the
                                    context IP address.

                                    Due to the collection mechanism, the captured IP address points to the instruction
                                    after the most time-intensive one. This causes the running time to get attributed to
                                    the next instruction (or sometimes to subsequent instructions) in the Assembly view.
                                    In rare cases, this can also lead to incorrect attribution of running time in the
                                    source. The time can be erroneously attributed to the source line after the actual
                                    hot line.

                                    If the inline mode is ON and the program has small functions inlined at the
                                    hotspots, this can cause the running time to be attributed to the wrong function
                                    since the next instruction can belong to a different function in tightly inlined
                                    code.

                                    The Indirect Branch Tracking hardware feature is momentarily disabled (while loading
                                    the drivers) in VTune driver collection mode if the feature is supported and enabled
                                    in the hardware and Linux operating system. There is no security impact expected
                                    during performance profiling after the drivers are loaded.

                                    Most of Intel® VTune™ Profiler profiling features work with a non-root install. Many
                                    features work on either a genuine Intel processor or a compatible processor.

                                    Some advanced features that use event-based sampling require the latest OS kernel or
                                    sampling driver to be installed. Intel Atom® processors also require this driver for
                                    analysis.
                                    <br><br>
                                    To install the driver on a system with a genuine Intel processor, launch the
                                    installer as root or ask your system administrator to install the driver later. For

                                    There is currently a limitation in the product regarding profiling application
                                    targets where the executable does not depend on the libpthread.so.0 library. The
                                    message "Link libpthread.so to the application statically and restart profiling"
                                    appears when profiling an application where program image does not depend on
                                    libpthread.so.0 but then it dlopen()s a shared library which does depend on
                                    libpthread.so.0. The collector is not able to follow the program execution and
                                    module load/unload so the collection results are likely to be misleading. A
                                    workaround is to set "LD_PRELOAD=libpthread.so.0" before running the collection.

                                    Due to a known Linux loader bug, VTune collection can sometimes fail when a user had
                                    libraries in LD_PRELOAD environment prior to launching VTune collection. The example
                                    of how the bug can manifest when having libzet_intercept.so in LD_PRELOAD:

                                        environment for the target application if it is required.
