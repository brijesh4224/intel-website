                            Kyoto University is home to the Academic Center for Computing and Media Studies (ACCMS), a
                            dynamic hub for advanced computation and media research. Over the years, the ACCMS has been
                            a focal point for advancing groundbreaking scientific research and development through its
                            state-of-the-art computational resources. This ongoing evolution reflects a commitment to
                            staying at the forefront of technological advancements, with the aim of pushing the
                            boundaries of computational research. </p>
                        <p class="my-3">However, amidst these advancements, it becomes apparent that certain challenges
                            persist. Many of the intricate simulation codes, integral to the research processes, face
                            constraints associated with memory bandwidth within the existing High-Performance Computing
                            (HPC) resources. In simpler terms, the speed at which these codes can read from or write to
                            memory emerges as a limiting factor, impacting their overall performance.
                        </p>
                        <p>This memory-bandwidth limitation presents an ongoing challenge for computational researchers.
                            To maximize the performance of their codes, they were looking to seek ways to optimize them
                            to work within these constraints. This could involve using memory more efficiently,
                            adjusting code to better match the memory hierarchy of the HPC systems, or even developing
                            new algorithms and techniques that are less reliant on memory bandwidth.</p>
                        <p class="my-3">It is this continuous quest for optimization that led Kyoto University to

                        <h2>The Need for Enhanced Computing Resources</h2>
                        <p>For effective scientific research, accelerating the production of results is a constant
                            objective. Beyond the requirement for quicker run times, researchers grapple with a host of
                            key challenges. These hurdles span a broad spectrum, from data management and analysis
                            complexities to the need for advanced computational resources. Understanding and addressing
                            these challenges is crucial for researchers to expedite scientific discoveries and
                            accelerate innovations.</p>
                        <p>The rapid advances in computing have led to an increasing demand for faster and larger
                            calculations. For Kyoto University, as the complexity and computational demands grew, the
                            need for more powerful resources became apparent. These advanced resources were essential in
                            providing the computational power needed to deliver results in shorter times and accelerate
                            research productivity. But, apart from the requirement for faster run times, another key
                            challenge is the need for more memory bandwidth per node as the workloads increase and the
                            need to handle tasks at larger scales arises.</p>
                        <p>“In the pursuit of advancing research outcomes, researchers consistently strive for expedited
                            and more extensive program execution,” explains Keiichiro Fukazawa, Associate Professor,
                            Computing Research Department, ACCMS, Kyoto University. “Their specific requirement revolves
                            around the necessity for a generous allocation of memory per node,” he adds.</p>
                        <h2>Finding the Solution</h2>
                        <p>The emphasis on faster processing and larger memory capacities to obtain scientific results
                            quickly reflects the continuous drive within the research community. This is important to
                            enhance the efficiency and capabilities of computational systems, to tackle increasingly
                            intricate and data-intensive scientific challenges. This was exactly what Kyoto University
                            was looking for when they started the process for updating ACCMS HPC systems.</p>
                        <p>Professor Fukazawa explains, “A few years earlier, our main HPC system was configured around
                            the Intel® Xeon Phi™ processor 7250. This setup included 16 GB of MCDRAM, and despite its
                            peak performance of 3 TFlops, the bandwidth was approximately 400 GB/s per unit, resulting
                            in a B/F value of 0.1333. This value represented a higher bandwidth compared to the DDR4
                            memory at that time. However, roughly five years post the implementation of the previous
                            system, advancements in computer technology have led to an increased demand for swifter and
                            larger computations. Furthermore, on the Intel Xeon Phi processor we also observed
                            performance degradation with non-vectorized applications, which seemed to stem from an issue
                            with the CPU core.”</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../img/Monika_img/camphor3.jpg" alt=""
                                style="width: 100%; object-fit: cover; box-sizing: border-box;">
                        </figure>
                        <p>In the context of HPC and supercomputing, where large-scale simulations and complex
                            computations are common, optimizing the performance of a system involves considering both
                            computational power and data transfer efficiency. The Bytes/Flop value (B/F value) provides
                            insights into how well a system utilizes its computational resources by indicating the
                            amount of data movement required for each floating-point operation. Taking this into
                            consideration, Professor Fukazawa emphasized the fact that the need of the hour was to
                            enhance their current systems with a CPU that comes with high B/F value.</p>
                        <p>So, under the guidance of Professor Fukazawa, ACCMS undertook the task of designing new
                            systems that incorporate cutting-edge technologies to address the vital need for higher
                            memory bandwidth performance in high-performance computing (HPC). The core design principle
                            of these systems revolved around a three-configuration system. “We initiated the
                            three-configuration system three generations ago, focusing on the power of many-core
                            processing with high memory bandwidth for our code, general-purpose use, and large memory
                            requirements”, Professor Fukazawa states.</p>

                        <p>He further elaborates on the goal behind this strategy, “Out of the three system types
                            (Figure 1)—System A (Camphor 3), System B (Laurel 3), and System C (Cinnamon 3)—Camphor 3 is
                            predominantly used by a majority of users. These users are primarily engaged in research
                            that involves the use of custom-built applications for scientific computations. Indeed, many
                            users prefer to use applications created during this period in their original form. In
                            essence, more than 80 percent of applications running on Camphor 3 necessitate a high B/F
                            value. Therefore, a CPU that could cater to these demands was required.”</p>

                            Performance</h2>
                        <p>To arrive at the new designs, Professor Fukazawa and his team researched the latest
                            technologies and ran benchmarks of the latest Intel Xeon CPU Max Series. This was crucial as
                            <a href="">Intel® Xeon® processors </a> provide max value, particularly in CPU performance.

                        </p>
                        <p>Intel Xeon CPU Max Series is optimized to leverage the broad range of software ecosystem that
                            includes compilers, math libraries, open-source applications, and more. Another key
                            advantage is that Intel Xeon CPU Max Series provides a seamless experience and enables the
                            best performance on a variety of the workloads. Apart from the performance benefits, Intel
                            Xeon CPU Max Series-based systems come with HBM support for enhancing the overall
                            performance and accelerating the research journey. This means that researchers can focus on
                            their true research and don’t need to spend much time for coding and optimization.</p>
                        <p>Explaining the reason behind choosing Intel Xeon CPU Max Series, Professor Fukazawa states,
                            “We required a user-friendly CPU for applications in the Kyoto University system, meaning
                            high B/F value, x86 CPU with DDR5, and large memory x86 system. And based on our research,
                            there were no CPUs apart from Intel’s that meet our requirements.” He further adds, “And,
                            when renewing the system, it was essential to choose a configuration with the highest
                            possible B/F value. At that point, the choice had to be a CPU equipped with HBM memory, and
                            the choices were inevitably narrowed down to two options: Intel Xeon CPU Max Series and
                            another CPU. However, when considering the computational performance, even if we used a CPU
                            that was a different option, the computational performance would only be about half of the
                            Intel Xeon CPU Max, making the Xeon CPU Max the ideal choice for our requirements.”</p>
                        <p>“On the other hand, although Laurel 3 does not have as high a need for a B/F value as Camphor
                            3, there were still a train of thoughts that emphasized on the need for a wider memory
                            bandwidth. Therefore, we started considering the possibility of using DDR5, but at the time
                            of consideration there were few CPU options that officially supported DDR5 and could meet
                            the required performance, so we benchmarked from several candidates and found the results.
                            In the end, 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors were chosen, taking into consideration
                            the timing of procurement and other factors.” Professor Fukazawa adds.</p>

                        <p>With the deployment of the new systems, Kyoto University has started seeing significant
                            performance gains. According to Professor Fukazawa, “Based on comparisons made with the
                            previous generation systems, Camphor 3 is already achieving an average speed increase of 4.7
                            times,1 and Laurel 3 is achieving an average speed increase of 3.7 times.”1 (Figures 2 and
                            3)</p>

                        <P>Emphasizing on how Intel Xeon CPU Max Series played a key role in driving this performance
                            advantage, Professor Fukazawa says, “At the center, we are conducting research called
                            program coding support joint research. This involves receiving the user’s code, optimizing
                            it over a period of about a year, and then returning it to the user. In the case of Intel
                            Xeon Phi processor, it is often necessary to optimize the application accordingly in order
                            to bring out the performance. However, for the Intel Xeon CPU Max Series, Intel’s compiler
                            and Math Kernel Library used as is, performance can be easily extracted without any special
                            optimization.”</P>
                        <P>To drive this point further, Professor Fukazawa provides a couple of examples of how the
                            Intel Xeon CPU Max Series plays a crucial role in advancing research and development, “In
                            one of the projects that I recently took up, I was working on an application that involves
                            solving the global Jovian magnetosphere with 3D MHD simulation. This is a high B/F value
                            application, and due to the huge size of the magnetosphere with small grid spacing, it takes
                            more than a year to observe the time evolution. However, with Intel Xeon CPU Max Series, I
                            was able obtain results at more than twice the speed. Another example is the general
                            circulation model (GCM) that is used to study the effects of global warming by running
                            simulations with various parameters. GCM is also a high B/F application, allowing
                            researchers to benefit from Intel Xeon CPU Max Series. The application helps in performing
                            simulations with multiple parameters and can identify parameters that may mitigate global
                            warming.”</P>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Getting Ready for the Future Ahead</h2>

                        <P>Reiterating the need to drive this collaboration further and achieve the milestones set by
                            Kyoto University, Katsumi Yazawa, Director of HPC Business Development, Industry Business
                            Unit, Intel Japan signs off, “We fully understand that the B/F value is important in the HPC
                            market. However, solutions that implement HBM and achieve high memory bandwidth will
                            inevitably be expensive. Therefore, at Intel, we understand the requirements and are
                            considering various new memory technologies. In the near future, we hope to improve the B/F
                            value by offering MCR-DIMMs that have the same form factor as DDR but can achieve nearly
                            twice the memory bandwidth. As a trusted advisor to Kyoto University, Intel is always
                            looking to enhance our collaboration and look forward to providing the roadmap for meeting
                            the requirements of HBM solution on HPC/AI in our long-term relation.”</P>
