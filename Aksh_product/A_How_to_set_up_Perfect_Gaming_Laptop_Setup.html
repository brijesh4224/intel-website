                                    <p class="V_pv">With the right setup, you can immerse yourself in games with a
                                        bigger screen, enjoy more precise control using gaming peripherals, and use a

                                        Basics</h2>
                                    <p class="V_pv mb-0">Finding an appropriately balanced system is the main challenge
                                        when
                                        picking out a gaming laptop. You’ll want to take a close look at the hardware,
                                        the design, and the connectivity options to ensure your new system can provide
                                        the experience you want.</p>
                                    <ul class="V_pv mb-0">
                                        <li><strong>Components</strong>. Choose a GPU and CPU that will provide the
                                            performance headroom you need. Keep in mind, you can’t easily replace these
                                            two critical components in most laptops. Look for a laptop with the
                                            components you need to play the games you want at the resolutions and frame
                                            rates you’re looking for.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Connectivity</strong>. Make sure the system has enough ports,
                                            particularly flexible ports like the Thunderbolt™ 3 port, which can connect
                                            to external monitors and external storage. With data transfer rates of up to
                                            40Gbps, the Thunderbolt™ 3 port is particularly useful when moving large
                                            files from an external drive. Not all laptops support Thunderbolt™ 3 ports,
                                            so be sure to consider this when choosing.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Design</strong>. Look for design elements you like, such as a slim
                                            chassis, thin bezels (the border around the screen), and durable frame
                                            materials like aluminum. Laptops with larger screens (17 inches and up) take
                                            up more room than 13 inch or 15 inch models, but can provide greater
                                            immersion. Thanks to improvements in thermal design, even powerful laptops
                                            can be quite thin: some systems come in under 1” thick. While weight and
                                            price are still impacted by the components you select, it’s certainly
                                            possible to get a high-performance gaming laptop in a small chassis.

                                            placement, proximity to your router, and anything else unique to your living

                                        from a laptop screen to a larger monitor. Hooking your gaming laptop up to a
                                        stand-alone display has a number of potential benefits:</p>
                                    <ul class="V_pv mb-0">
                                        <li><strong>Split tasks between multiple screens</strong>. Play on one display
                                            while leaving your chat client, streaming software, or work open on the
                                            other.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Center your monitor in an ergonomic position.</strong> By adjusting
                                            the height of your monitor so that the top sits at (or slightly below) your
                                            eye level, you can help maintain a comfortable viewing angle. This can help
                                            prevent neck strain that can result from tilting your head up or down when
                                            looking at a screen.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Consider a higher resolution monitor</strong>. Upping the resolution
                                            to 1440p or 4K (if higher than your laptop’s native resolution) can provide
                                            a sharper image, as long as your laptop has the components necessary to play
                                            at these higher resolutions. Jumping from a 13”-17” laptop screen to a 27”
                                            monitor (or larger) can improve image clarity, and also allows for the
                                            option of higher refresh rates or adaptive sync solutions that can help
                                            prevent screen tearing.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Follow fast-moving action easily with higher refresh rate
                                                monitors,</strong> such as 144Hz (or higher) models. Many laptops make
                                            use of high refresh rate screens, but not all, and upgrading to a larger
                                            screen that takes advantage of this technology can enhance your gaming
                                            experience.

                                                sight. When connected to the dock, you can take full advantage of the

                                                several cables when you disconnect your laptop. Disconnecting from a

                                                and can even save wear and tear on ports.
