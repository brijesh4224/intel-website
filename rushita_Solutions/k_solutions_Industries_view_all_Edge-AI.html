                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Innovative capabilities at the <a href="#">edge</a>,
                            facilitated by advancements in computing performance and efficiency, are bringing together
                            the physical and digital worlds. Edge AI, which brings <a href="#">AI</a>&nbsp;to local
                            devices and sensors, enables rapid data analysis and action independent of the cloud or data
                            center. This unlocks near-real-time responsiveness and insights, increased efficiency,
                            reduced operational costs, and the ability to deliver new types of customer experiences.</p>



                        <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5 pt-4" id="key2">Role of AI at the Edge</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Whether the end goal is automating medical imaging workflows
                            to accelerate diagnosis or improving operational efficiency at a metal fabrication plant,
                            AI’s role at the edge is the same—to leverage data to take action faster. Within the realm
                            of AI, this is achieved through a task known as inference.<br>
                            <br>
                            During inference, live input data is fed into an AI model that has been previously trained
                            to carry out functions such as making decisions, sending alerts, providing insights, or
                            completing tasks such as sorting images.<br>
                            <br>
                            Edge AI frequently uses Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including cameras, data sources,
                            and sensors, to collect and analyze data out in the real world. Say an <a href="#">energy or
                                utility company</a>&nbsp;wants to keep their towers, pipelines, or grids safe from bad
                            actors. Security video and sensor data can be processed at the edge, automatically alerting
                            operators to threats in near-real time. With the ability to collect and process data nearly
                            instantaneously, edge AI vastly expands an organization’s capabilities, enabling an array of
                            AI-based applications and experiences at the edge. From a chatbot running on a bank kiosk,
                            to cars with automated lane assist and collision avoidance capabilities, to near-real-time
                            alerting of safety hazards or incidents on city streets or the plant floor, the use cases
                            for edge AI across industries are quite expansive.
                        </p>
                        <h3><br>
                            <strong>Edge AI vs. Traditional AI</strong>
                        </h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Traditionally, AI has primarily been cloud based, with data
                            being sent to the data center, where it is processed and returned post analysis. Such
                            cloud-centric compute infrastructure models are not ideal for time-sensitive enterprise
                            processes and operations.<br>
                            <br>
                            Many enterprise inference use cases benefit from data being analyzed very fast. They often
                            require real-time data processing and have strict latency requirements. Quite often, they
                            need to be implemented at locations with poor connectivity, making them vulnerable to delays
                            and errors from data packet loss during transmission to and from the cloud.<br>
                            <br>
                            To address these needs and challenges, edge AI performs data analysis at the data source,
                            such as the <a href="#">plant floor</a>, the <a href="#">hospital</a>, or the <a
                                href="#">storefront</a>. Algorithms are deployed on-site, where the data is processed
                            either in a central hub or directly on edge devices with <a href="#">built-in
                                processors</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong>Hybrid Edge AI</strong></h3>
                        <p><br>
                            These two approaches, edge AI and cloud AI, are not mutually exclusive. As AI at the edge
                            advances, a hybrid edge approach that distributes inference workloads between the edge and
                            the cloud is expected to become widely adopted. The idea is that lightweight, near-real-time
                            insight at the edge can be bolstered by deeper context in the cloud.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">By combining the speed and efficiency of the edge with
                            scalable cloud-based resources, the hybrid edge will facilitate cutting-edge applications
                            with diverse deployment environments and performance demands. A hybrid approach will also
                            allow enterprises to aggregate input from multiple models into their processes.<br>
                            <br>
                            While edge AI is often associated with <a href="">computer vision</a>, the edge AI landscape
                            is rapidly expanding to include multi-model applications involving <a href="">generative AI

                            use cases are expected to <a href="">revolutionize industries</a>. In manufacturing,
                            generative AI-driven software could facilitate an agile and dynamic supply chain, while <a

                                boosting data transfer rates.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cost-effectiveness: </strong>The growing volume of data from sensors and devices
                                makes edge computing more cost-effective than sending data to the cloud and back. Less
                                bandwidth is consumed, and fewer cloud-based resources are needed, helping to reduce
                                operational expenses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Energy conservation:</strong> Energy-efficient edge AI devices are designed to
                                facilitate low-power computing and can be significantly more efficient than cloud-based
                                processing. Meanwhile, networking hardware like routers and switches consume less power,
                                as traffic to and from the data center is minimized.</li>
                            <li><strong>Security and data sovereignty:</strong> Keeping sensitive data at the edge helps
                                to reduce security and privacy risks by ensuring local control, autonomy, and compliance
                                with regulations.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3><strong>Edge AI Considerations</strong></h3>
                        <p>Bringing AI to edge environments presents new challenges when compared to running AI in the
                            public or private cloud, including:<br>
                            &nbsp;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Adding AI to existing investments:</strong> Many edge environments feature
                                legacy, fixed-function infrastructure with a variety of proprietary equipment and
                                software. Proprietary technologies with incompatible formats may present technical
                                challenges when integrating them with an edge solution.</li>
                            <li><strong>Training and fine-tuning models: </strong>Edge AI models are unique and must be
                                tuned for a specific industry or use case. Human domain knowledge is often critical in
                                these cases. Enterprises need simple tools that help non‒data scientist experts
                                transform their expertise into AI capabilities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Addressing hardware diversity:</strong> Edge-native applications will likely
                                span a multitude of nodes, operating systems, connectivity protocols, compute and
                                storage needs, energy and cost constraints, and compliance concerns. Developers need
                                ways to deal with this complexity and support a distributed heterogeneous computing
                                environment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Securing and managing distributed applications: </strong>Enterprises face new
                                challenges as they seek to support advanced AI at the edge. Manageability is critical to
                                applying AI at scale, and security is a necessity at every step along the way.</li>
                            <li><strong>Planning for rugged or constrained conditions:</strong> Edge environments place
                                different kinds of stress on AI hardware, such as heat, moisture, or vibration. Edge AI
                                solutions for use cases like traffic monitoring or quality assurance often need to be
                                placed in areas with small amounts of physical real estate. Making it all happen with
                                low power usage is also important for controlling costs and promoting sustainability.
                            </li>

                        <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5 pt-5" id="key4">Edge AI Solutions</h3>
                        <p>How to modernize business operations with edge AI technology is a deep and multifaceted
                            topic. Some organizations, such as those in manufacturing and industrial, will be looking to
                            add edge technology and “intelligence” to legacy operational equipment as they evolve into a
                            digital enterprise that uses near-real-time data to deliver value. Others, such as those in
                            the financial and healthcare industries, have large, data-centric operations that are too
                            vast or disparate for human monitoring and analysis. These organizations are moving toward
                            digitizing and automating their data processes to uncover patterns and insights more quickly
                            and to improve efficiency, compliance, and data security.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Regardless of which challenges an organization is trying to

                            wide-spanning use cases will require an <a href="">AI tech stack</a>&nbsp;of edge-to-cloud
                            technologies, getting started with edge AI can be done without a major infrastructure
                            investment. Businesses with current edge environments are likely ready to get started with
                            AI today. Existing edge compute resources—like point of sale (POS) systems, industrial PCs,
                            and local servers in healthcare offices—can support many AI workloads, including computer
                            vision.</p>
                        <h3><strong>Integration Considerations</strong></h3>
                        <p>The main challenge to implementing an edge AI solution is overcoming the inherent complexity
                            involved in coordinating the various pieces that make up the solution, including compute
                            infrastructure, IoT devices, and legacy equipment. A unified technology platform can help
                            reduce this complexity and promote interoperability between multiple AI environments and
                            standardization across heterogeneous infrastructure, creating a unified fabric from edge to
                            cloud.</p>
                        <h3><strong>Hardware Considerations</strong></h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Whether training models in the cloud, fine-tuning them, or
                            deploying them at the edge, choosing the right <a href=""> hardware</a>&nbsp;can help
                            businesses right-size their investment and support performance requirements.<br>
                            AI processors support the entire AI pipeline—from massively complex model training to
                            simpler AI needs, including incorporating AI in end user devices:<br>
                            &nbsp;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Central processing units (CPUs) with built-in accelerator engines can help power many
                                advanced edge AI workloads without the need for specialized hardware.</li>
                            <li class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1"><a href="">GPU solutions</a>&nbsp;can help power the
                                most demanding workloads in the data center, at the edge, or in end user devices.</li>
                            <li class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1"><a href="">FPGAs</a>&nbsp;are often used as <a
                                    href="">AI accelerators</a>&nbsp;and AI processors to help enable AI workloads from
                                edge to cloud. Compared to CPUs and GPUs, FPGAs are more versatile and can be
                                reconfigured to suit a wide variety of use cases. FPGAs offer a combination of speed,
                                programmability, and flexibility to deliver performance without the cost and complexity
                                of developing custom chips.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3><strong>Selecting an Adoption Approach</strong></h3>
                        <p>Organizations looking to extend AI applications to the edge generally fall into three
                            categories: those looking to purchase a purpose-built AI solution or application, those
                            looking to build their own AI application, and those looking to achieve their AI goals
                            through some combination of the two approaches.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1"><strong>Building an AI solution:</strong> For those seeking
                            to build their own edge AI solutions from the ground up, vendor-agnostic, edge-native
                            software platforms can help with building, deploying, and iterating on <a href="">AI
                                workflows</a>&nbsp;and feature the broadest interoperability and protocol support.
                            Post-deployment edge-native platforms also make it simpler to manage and update AI software
                            across all distributed edge environments.<br>
                            When vetting platforms, it is important to look for:<br>
                            &nbsp;</p>
                        <ul>

                            <li>Cloud-like autoscaling and containerization features<br>
                                &nbsp;</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Purchasing ready-made AI solutions:</strong> Enterprise organizations can also
                            purchase AI solutions from a solution provider or system integrator. These vendors provide
                            integrated hardware and software systems tailored to specific industry use cases and needs.
                            It is important to choose a market-ready solution that has interoperable AI capabilities and
                            a proven track record of successful industry and domain-specific deployments.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1"><strong>Taking a combined approach: </strong>Many
                            organizations find that combining their own development efforts with prebuilt components can
                            be the most efficient way to achieve AI success. A range of tutorials and resources
                            demonstrating edge AI use cases are available and can help accelerate time to value and
                            simplify development. Additionally, there is a wide range of <a href="">software
                                resources</a>&nbsp;that can help ease the development lift, including frameworks,
                            toolkits, industry-specific development tools, reference architectures, and reference
                            implementations.</p>
