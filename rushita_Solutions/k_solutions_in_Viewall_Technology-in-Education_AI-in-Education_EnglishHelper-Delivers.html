                        <p>English proficiency in developing economies like India affects the economic and social
                            well-being of people. This issue adds considerable value to the social significance English
                            proficiency holds. Most government-run schools in India use the local language as the medium
                            of education and English language learning and proficiency is often challenging for the
                            students. EnglishHelper (EH), a language learning technology company and social
                            enterprise<sup>1</sup>, realized the criticality of this challenge. They partnered with
                            Schoolnet India Ltd, an education and skilling organization, to find a long-term solution.
                            Built on the premise that language is best learned in a multi-sensory
                            environment<sup>2</sup>, ReadToMe, an AI software equipped with text-to-speech voice
                            technology for multi-sensory reading and comprehension, was developed. Partnering with Intel
                            and Amazon Web Services (AWS), EH was able to achieve scalability and provide the software
                            to government-run schools across all states in India, which is now supporting the students
                            of more than 25,000 schools and expected to grow to beyond 100,000 schools in
                            2021-22.<sup>3</sup></p>

                        <h2 class="k_26px mt-5 fw-lighter pt-4">Implementing Technology-Based Learning</h2>
                        <p>Surveys conducted over the past decade across government schools in India show a significant
                            gap in reading and comprehension ability of students.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;A majority of
                            government schools in India, especially in rural areas, use the local vernacular or state’s
                            official language as the medium of education. According to the 8th All India Educational
                            Surveys (AIES), English as a medium of instruction was used only in 15.49% schools at the
                            primary stage, 21.08% schools at the upper primary stage, 28.73% schools at the secondary
                            stage and 33.06% schools at the higher secondary stage.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Learning English
                            for students of government schools is difficult for a variety of reasons—English phonics are
                            arbitrary and challenging for students who are not exposed to English in their daily lives.
                            Also, there are issues caused by teacher shortages and teachers’ English proficiency.</p>
                        <p>Acquiring English language skills opens opportunities for students in India by providing a
                            wide range of higher education and employment options in the future. EnglishHelper,
                            recognized the implications the absence of English language skills had on the future of
                            these students. To help students overcome this hurdle, EH created a long-term solution in
                            the form of ReadToMe, an AI software that facilitates multi-sensory reading and
                            comprehension.</p>
                        <p>To ensure a wider reach, EH launched the RightToRead program that implements ReadToMe in
                            various learning environments to support the learning needs of
                            students.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;They approached several states within India to explore the
                            possibilities this solution could open up for the students of government-run schools,
                            especially in rural areas. This enabled EH to work with the governments across the country
                            and deploy the RightToRead program in more than 25,000 schools impacting the lives of over
                            10M students and 100,000 teachers.<sup>3</sup></p>

                        <p><em>Platform to Develop English Language Skills</em></p>
                        <p>EH—in association with Schoolnet, Intel, and AWS—has successfully implemented its ReadToMe
                            software in digitally equipped government schools across multiple states. The software
                            implemented in the RightToRead program is equipped with AI enabled multi-sensory technology
                            that makes learning interactive for the students and enhances teacher effectiveness.
                            Implemented for students from grades 1 through 12, EH found that students undertaking
                            ReadToMe-enabled classes showed 20–40% higher improvement in reading and comprehension, as
                            measured by independent evaluations by third parties.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;This significant
                            result is made possible by consistent exposure that enables students to learn English
                            phonics and improve word recognition. Additionally, adapting it with the curriculum ensures
                            practical implementation of the prescribed textbooks and eliminates the need for extended
                            classroom sessions. Today, ReadToMe empowers more than 10M students in over 25,000
                            schools<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;by providing them with a wholesome learning experience in the
                            classroom and beyond.</p>
                        <p>The most recent state to implement the RightToRead program is Andhra Pradesh. As an
                            initiative to include English as the medium of education in all government schools, the
                            state along with EH introduced the Anglodayam project, which extends the RightToRead program
                            solutions in residential schools of the state’s tribal and social welfare
                            departments.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Together with Intel and AWS, EH successfully deployed the
                            program in 210 schools. More than 40,000 students and 300 teachers in remote parts of Andhra
                            Pradesh use the program.</p>

                        <h2 class="k_26px mt-5 fw-lighter pt-4">Solutions that Transform Language Learning</h2>
                        <p>The vision to create an impact propelled EH to find multiple solutions that could be included
                            in the RightToRead program that assist not just the students, but also aid the teachers. As
                            the program was intended for government-run schools, especially in rural regions, EH
                            realized that most teachers were not completely equipped with grade-appropriate language
                            proficiency. To enable teachers with the right skills, EH provided the teachers with a
                            learning solution, EnglishBolo, which is assigned based on their English proficiency.
                            Through EnglishBolo, teachers are enabled to improve proficiency and increase familiarity
                            with the ReadToMe solutions. A blend of self-learning and live tutoring sessions provide the
                            teachers with a safe learning and practice environment. EnglishBolo is undoubtedly of
                            immense value to teachers, but in implementing the program EH has demonstrated that nearly
                            60% of teachers are below desired level of English proficiency. This gap has to be closed
                            quickly if the state government wants to successfully transition to English as the medium of
                            education.</p>
                        <p>Teachers completing the EnglishBolo program are equipped with the knowledge necessary to
                            implement the ReadToMe School Edition and ReadToMe Virtual Classroom. These solutions assist
                            students from grades 1 through 12 to learn curriculum-based English lessons both in a
                            classroom environment and remotely. ReadToMe School Edition leverages the school’s
                            information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure to provide a multisensory
                            learning experience using visual and auditory aids, which are controlled by the teacher.
                            This maximizes student participation and involvement in the lessons. ReadToMe Virtual
                            Classroom enables teachers to continue remote, online teaching of English, without hampering
                            lesson plans. To augment classroom learning for students, EH implemented the ReadToMe
                            Student Edition that provides students with the required academic support outside school. A
                            self-learning app, it can be installed on Android devices, enabling students to read and
                            comprehend school curriculum textbooks.</p>

                        </h2>
                        <p>Amazon EC2 M5 instances, with the computational power of 2nd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable
                            processors and Intel AVX-512 and Intel DL Boost, enabled EH to seamlessly deploy the
                            AI-based RightToRead program across schools in urban and rural parts of India. The
                            Relational Database Service (RDS) that AWS provides, in addition to Intel® Performance
                            Libraries, helps with setup, operation, and scaling of the database used for the
                            application. The Intel AVX-512 extension along with AWS content delivery networks (CDNs)
                            greatly enhance the performance of EH’s machine learning algorithms and improve application
                            availability and performance.</p>
                        <p>To help with the storage and accessibility of course materials, Amazon Simple Storage Service
                            (Amazon S3) on Intel architecture is used, which ensures easy organization and management of
                            data. The Intel AVX-512 extension also enhances compute intensive operations using AWS
                            Lambda to train ReadToMe to read textbooks properly. Additionally, AWS services such as
                            CloudWatch for real-time alerts, CloudWatch Logs for logs analysis and application, and
                            GuardDuty for security and unauthorized access are also implemented for this program.</p>
                        <p>With 2nd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors, the EC2 instances improve the ability to
                            scale by providing the necessary computation power. This has now enabled EH to extend the
                            program to several thousands of schools simultaneously. The scalability also ensures that
                            several millions of students and teachers in various learning environments are enabled to

                        <h2 class="k_26px mt-5 fw-lighter pt-4">Seamless Deployment Using AWS and Intel</h2>
                        <p>One of the major challenges that EH faced was deploying the software to multiple schools
                            simultaneously. Sriram Shankar, CTO at EH, states, “during the early stages of the program
                            we physically deployed the software to schools using CDs, which took a long time to install
                            and set up. Working with Intel and AWS, we could migrate the solutions to an AWS cloud from
                            our on-premises data center ensuring that our deployments are highly efficient.”</p>
                        <p>Intel architecture and AWS cloud helped provide scalable computing capacity while keeping
                            costs low and delivering advanced features that enhance the learning experience. With
                            automated deployment, QA solutions, and stateless servers—made possible using Amazon EC2 M5
                            instances based on Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors—EH was able to bring down deployment
                            times from 4 hours to 30 minutes and planned downtimes for every release from 4 hours to a
                            few minutes. Moving to the cloud also ensured that the installation and registration of the
                            software could be done under 30 minutes.<sup>7</sup></p>
                        <p>Another challenge that EH faced was providing effective operational support for all the
                            schools that were using the program, especially in remote locations. The need to physically
                            visit each school and limited information provided about the functioning of the software
                            meant increased operational costs and a larger team size. Working with Intel powered AWS
                            instances and cloud helped EH to manage the infrastructure with a team of just two personnel
                            while significantly lowering their capital expenses. With most routine tasks like
                            provisioning of servers, scaling in response to demand, and healing being managed by Intel
                            and AWS, EH could focus on improving their infrastructure and solving for real customer
                            issues.</p>

                        <h2 class="k_26px mt-5 fw-lighter pt-4">Creating a Better Future with English</h2>
                        <p>With the program offered by EH, students are enabled with the ability to speak and write
                            English. Opportunities to study further and be eligible for desired jobs are a direct result
                            of this program that further improves the incomes of rural households of India. The
                            association with Intel and AWS helps EH provide this transformative skill to more students
                            each year. The capabilities and impact highlighted by the results is inspiring other states
                            to implement the program.</p>
                        <p>Utilizing Intel architecture and AWS technology, EH can now achieve uninterrupted scalability
                            in the near future and implement their solutions in more than 100,000 schools across all
                            states in India. This solution will effectively help EH make a lasting impact on the lives
                            of over 20M students and 500,000 teachers<sup>3</sup>, enabling them with improved learning
