                            Large language models (LLMs) hold tremendous potential for helping companies realize operational efficiencies and build compelling AI-driven tools. Prediction Guard, a startup company operating at the forefront of AI integration, wants to help organizations unleash that potential faster.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            While LLMs are proving their utility across a wide range of generative AI (GenAI) applications, they can bring risks when it comes to reliability, variability, and security. That makes them challenging to deploy for many use cases, especially ones in which human safety and enterprise compliance are top considerations.
                        </p>

                            <a class="b_special_a1" href="">Prediction Guard</a> is working to reduce those risks, while leveraging <a class="b_special_a1" href="">Intel<sup>®</sup> Developer Cloud</a> and <a class="b_special_a1" href="">Intel<sup>®</sup> Gaudi<sup>®</sup> 2 processors</a> to run more efficiently and effectively as it helps organizations integrate LLMs into their AI-enabled business applications.

                        <p>
                            Founded at the beginning of 2023, Prediction Guard has rapidly built a client portfolio spanning a range of industries. Many of the company’s clients recognize that LLMs can be game changers. Those organizations are looking to leverage LLMs in GenAI applications such as information extraction, customer service and analytics, marketing campaign planning, financial reporting, and “co-pilot” solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One prime use case supports medical providers by automatically drafting medical forms based on information extracted from physician dictations (a scenario in which private data and LLM outputs need to be handled securely and reliably). Other use cases integrate private customer data to generate answers to supply chain questions or to respond to retail customers based on purchase behavior, inventory, and order information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “The use cases are almost limitless,” said Daniel Whitenack, Prediction Guard’s founder. “Businesses see opportunities everywhere they look. They see how they can use GenAI tools such as large language models to unlock the full power of their data—to create new insights and experiences that can take business outcomes to the next level. But they also recognize that there are still huge obstacles to overcome.” 
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-0">
                            One key challenge, according to Whitenack, is that the output of LLMs can vary, making them unreliable. They are sometimes prone to “hallucinations,” with results that are factually inaccurate or toxic. And they are also vulnerable to an emerging type of security threat known as prompt injections, in which an attacker uses a malicious input to elicit an unintended response or data breach from the model.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “All of these challenges can make it tricky for organizations to gain traction with LLMs. They want to avoid liabilities, and they don’t want to risk the loss of sensitive data such as personally identifiable information. Many of them also lack the data talent and other resources needed to address these issues,” Whitenack said. “Our solution helps remove these barriers to adoption, but it requires significant and reliable computing power—something we have been able to access through Intel Developer Cloud.”
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Prediction Guard’s platform provides its customers with access to multiple LLMs while integrating additional capabilities and technologies that deal with harmful inputs (like prompt injections) and harmful outputs (like inaccuracies or toxicity)—all hosted in a secure, private environment on Intel Developer Cloud, running Intel Gaudi 2 deep-learning processors. The company is also using the Hugging Face Optimum Habana library (a collaboration between Intel and Hugging Face) in Intel Developer Cloud to optimize the models it runs on the processors.

                        <p>
                            Based on an open software foundation with <a class="b_special_a1" href="">oneAPI</a>, Intel Developer Cloud allows users to learn, test and run applications on a cluster of the latest Intel<sup>®</sup> hardware and software. It gives developers access to Intel<sup>®</sup> technologies for pre-launch development and testing, as well as supplying a full stack solution for building and deploying AI applications at scale. Intel Developer Cloud also offers developers hardware choice and freedom from proprietary programming models, which supports accelerated computing, code reuse, and portability.

                            The Intel Gaudi 2 processors provided in Intel Developer Cloud are helping Prediction Guard address some of the big needs that come with a growing business and with client expectations for rapid, reliable GenAI outcomes. Designed as an AI accelerator, the Intel Gaudi 2 processor features 7 nanometer process technology, heterogeneous compute, 24 tensor processor cores, and dual-matrix multiplication engines. It also includes 24 100-GbE integrated on chip, 96 GB HBM2E memory on board, 48 MB SRAM, and integrated media control.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before moving to Intel Gaudi 2 processors on Intel Developer Cloud, Prediction Guard tried processors from another provider. The new Intel-based environment has provided a significant boost for Prediction Guard and its clients in multiple areas, according to Whitenack.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “For certain models, following our move to Intel Gaudi 2, we have seen our costs decrease while throughput has increased by 2x—which means we can help customers generate outputs faster and more cost-effectively.1 It’s also now easier for us to get access to the processing power we need in the cloud—something that was often scarce with our previous provider,” he said. “That greater availability also allows us to scale more readily to meet the growing needs of our clients and our own business.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For Prediction Guard clients with especially sensitive data considerations, Whitenack said Intel Developer Cloud allows the company to create client-specific deployments that protect customer data while maintaining the easy-to-use Prediction Guard API.

                        <p>
                            One other advantage of Intel Developer Cloud stems from Prediction Guard’s involvement in <a class="b_special_a1" href="">Intel<sup>®</sup> Liftoff for Startups</a>, a program that provides startups with access to the computational power they need and fosters collaboration among startups to help them refine and enhance their offerings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “Our participation in Intel Liftoff was critical for getting us where we are today. It allowed us to explore the art of the possible with Intel Gaudi 2 processors and demonstrate early on that our system could run effectively on Intel Developer Cloud at the speed and scale we needed,” Whitenack said.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As Prediction Guard has moved fully into production with Intel Gaudi 2 processors on Intel Developer Cloud, the company continues to see benefits from Intel Liftoff. Whitenack said the program provides rapid access to Intel experts who help answer questions and address issues as Prediction Guard continues to innovate using Intel technology.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “That’s one of the greatest things about this relationship. The compute and the community are here,” Whitenack said. “And so are the results. Intel Developer Cloud provides a full-fledged AI cloud environment that can support our business as we continue to innovate and grow.”

                        <p>
                            Prediction Guard is realizing greater speed, security, scalability, and reliability, as well as reduced costs, using Intel Gaudi 2 AI accelerator processors on Intel Developer Cloud. The technology is providing a 2x throughput increase for some large language models, for example, allowing the company to support clients using LLMs for a variety of innovative GenAI applications.<sup>1</sup>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And Intel Developer Cloud is having a measurable impact on Prediction Guard’s bottom line. Because the company has ported critical model hosting onto Intel Gaudi 2 machines in Intel Developer Cloud, it has a better view of its fixed costs. That means the company can conduct more accurate cost planning and flexibly adjust the models it runs.
