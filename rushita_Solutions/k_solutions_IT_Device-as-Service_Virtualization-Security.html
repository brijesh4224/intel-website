                                Cyberattacks are increasingly common. When attacks occur, it is important to get systems back up and running as quickly as possible. Virtualization supports resiliency by helping to protect the main OS kernel, application, and secrets from malware. Virtualization also enables the creation of multiple isolated work environments, which could be used, for example, to allow separation between work and personal activity for better security, data privacy, and compliance. Intel hardware security augments software-based security solutions with hardware-enforced virtualization security primitives to create trusted and performant virtual machines.

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4" id="key1">What Is Virtualization?</h3>
                        <p>Virtualization takes a single physical computer or server and partitions it into several virtual machines by separating computing environments from physical infrastructure. On shared virtualized hardware, multiple workloads can run in full isolation from each other in a performant manner.</p>
                        <p>Many businesses today leverage client virtualization for these and other advantages:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The ability to run different operating systems or modified versions of the same operating system. This enables, for example, a programmer to code in both Linux and Windows 10 on the same machine.</li>
                            <li>Isolating workloads on the same PC for better security, resilience, and system uptime.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Virtualization enables isolated workspaces to be launched on any compliant PC. Since workspaces are isolated, a workspace has less of an impact on the others. This also enables businesses to deliver a resilient service to employees and business partners alike.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately, virtualization helps secure digital assets, promote system uptime, and preserve business continuity.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4" id="key2">Trends Driving Virtualization</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">One prominent trend driving the rise in virtualization is the increasing number of employees who are working remotely. Accordingly, company PCs are now routinely deployed in the home, and <a href="#">IT security</a>&nbsp;teams are seeing an increase in personal business being conducted on company PCs. As employees visit websites, shop online, and interact on social media sites, they may inadvertently expose the company network to malicious code. This paradigm also puts a company’s internal systems at risk because home networks may lack adequate security protections.</p>
                        <p>Consider also the growing gig economy and that contract workers often serve multiple businesses from a single PC. If even one of a contractor’s clients has suffered a breach, all client environments connected to the shared PC may be immediately at risk.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">In separating out different workspaces for users such as remote employees and independent contractors, <a href="#">business PC virtualization</a>&nbsp;delivers both the data security and privacy protections organizations require. Leveraging hardware telemetry and platform attestation allows IT personnel and antivirus solutions to quickly identify and address performance bottlenecks and breaches without significant impacts to compute performance or business continuity.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4" id="key3">Why Cyberattacks Are Rising</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Small and medium-sized businesses are increasingly being targeted by ransomware gangs. Attackers are now employing cryptojacking malware at alarming rates, a trend that is expected to continue. Attackers today continue to leverage AI to evolve their methods as well and are often able to evade antimalware defenses by <a href="#">cloaking in virtual machines</a>&nbsp;or through binary obfuscating.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1"><a href="#">PC endpoints</a>&nbsp;used by a remote workforce offer an easy way for malware to steal corporate secrets from PCs connected to insecure home and public networks. In addition, such PC endpoints offer a direct pathway for malware to infect cloud systems. Once an MSP or SaaS provider cloud has been breached, ransomware often moves laterally to compromise other connected machines.</p>
                        <p>While businesses today typically rely on software-based security to protect their digital assets, security software can be bypassed by an attacker who has obtained higher privileges through a vulnerability in either the software or hardware.</p>
                        <p>To address security threats on all fronts, businesses need to adopt a defense-in-depth security model built on advanced hardware virtualization security capabilities.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter k_plink1 k_intext1blue1 mt-5 pt-4" id="key4">Protecting Virtualizations with Intel® Hardware-Based Security</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1"><a href="#">Hardware-based security capabilities</a>&nbsp;bring much-needed layers of protection to virtualized workloads. By design, embedded hardware security technology has a better view of the computing environment than software-based security solutions because it resides at the system level. Hardware-based security capabilities augment traditional software-based tools with a multidimensional approach that includes below-the-operating-system security features.</p>
                        <p>To provide defense-in-depth virtualization security, Intel offers a full portfolio of hardware-based security technologies:</p>
                        <h3>Security with Intel vPro® and Intel vPro® Security</h3>

                        <p>Intel vPro®’s&nbsp;hardware-based security capabilities help enable profiling and detection of ransomware and other threats that can compromise data and degrade CPU performance.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Intel vPro®&nbsp;helps protect the entire fleet of devices in an organization, with a multilevel approach that includes protection from firmware-level attacks on the BIOS and endpoint management support so IT staff can monitor, restore, and patch devices remotely. <a href="#">Endpoint management</a>, in particular, helps protect the fleet and reaches devices that are not physically accessible.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">Embedded in&nbsp;all Windows PCs build on&nbsp;Intel vPro®, <a href="#">Intel vPro® Security</a>&nbsp;enables workload isolation to help reduce the attack surface of computing environments and prevent malware from persisting and spreading across resources.</p>
                        <p>The security features of Intel vPro® Security allow businesses to benefit from deep platform visibility, hardware-based isolation to protect credentials, browser isolation, and hypervisor protection against malware executing code.</p>
                        <h3>Intel® Threat Detection Technology</h3>
                        <p>Intel® Threat Detection Technology (Intel® TDT), applies machine learning to CPU telemetry to help detect malware code execution fingerprints, irrespective of obfuscation techniques.</p>
                        <p>Intel® TDT works on virtualized Windows machines by first filtering out false positives and then signaling off the attack to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, which can apply numerous remediation measures, including killing the malware process. The entire cycle happens in seconds, preventing impacts to the user’s machine and preserving the user’s computing experience.</p>
                        <p>Because Intel® TDT is an established model that is continuously updated, it works with CPUs from previous Intel® Core™ processor generations and will work with Intel-based PCs for years to come.</p>
                        <h3>Intel’s Commitment to Product Assurance</h3>
                        <p>Intel is highly committed to product and security assurance. As part of this commitment, Intel regularly releases functional and security updates for supported products and services through its Intel® Platform Update (Intel® IPU) program.</p>
                        <p>Through the IPU program, the Intel ecosystem of partners works to validate and integrate Intel® product updates into their own solutions and then releases the updates through direct channels. Ultimately, the IPU process facilitates coordination and vulnerability handling across the ecosystem, keeping Intel® platform users protected from advances in malicious code.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 k_plink1 k_intext1blue1 pt-4" id="key5">Securing Virtualization with Intel</h3>
                        <p>While IT departments have struggled for decades to manage an ever-changing threat landscape, deploying client virtualizations can help by isolating workloads and reducing the attack surface accordingly.</p>
                        <p>Intel® hardware-enabled security provides defense in depth by enabling the expansive platform visibility and advanced threat detection required to protect today’s remote workforces deployed at vulnerable endpoints. Ultimately, Intel vPro® Enterprise for Windows OS allows virtualized environments to deliver on their promise, enabling the speed, performance, and agility users have come to expect while also providing the foundational virtualization security needed to thwart today’s increasingly sophisticated attacks.</p>

                    </h5>
                    <p>Endpoints are the portals hackers use to access your critical data or embed malicious code in your systems. And today’s workplace has a wide array of devices that can challenge endpoint security. Built-in to all Windows PCs on Intel vPro®, <a href="#" class="k_a_whiteunder">Intel vPro® Security</a>&nbsp;enables your IT team to implement policies in the hardware layer to help ensure that if malicious code is injected, it cannot access data.</p>

                    <p>IT will often use system hardening to optimize their endpoint security strategy, and&nbsp;Intel vPro® Security makes that process more comprehensive. The benefit to your organization includes configurable firmware protection, BIOS security to reduce its attack surface, and advanced <a href="#" class="k_a_whiteunder">threat detection</a>.</p>
