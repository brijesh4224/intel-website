                        <h2>The Importance of Imaging Exam Results in Medical Research</h2>
                        <p>Every year, the Heart Institute of the University of São Paulo (lnCor) performs about 200,000
                            imaging studies, and each of them may contain one to thousands of images. In addition to
                            serving the hundreds of thousands of patients who visit the institution annually, the
                            institution has built an essential database to conduct medical research.</p>
                        <p>In addition to being a reference center in cardiology, lnCor is also an important center for
                            medical research, and many of these studies are based on the institution's collection of
                            exams. However, medical ethics define that sensitive data of patients cannot be disclosed by
                            researchers and must be kept confidential.</p>
                        <p>Sensitive data refer to information that allows patient identification, such as name, age,
                            birth date, among others; and these data cannot be shared by hospitals with third parties
                            without prior consent of the patient. Until now, data anonymization was extremely difficult
                            due to the lack of a standard implemented in the place where they are stored in imaging
                            exams and due to the display format of each exam (which varies significantly).</p>
                        <p>Today, data privacy is ensured by confidentiality agreements signed by the researchers, who
                            agree not to disclose critical data about the cases studied and only use them responsibly.
                            But this model does not allow a massive use of exams, which need to be evaluated and have
                            their data anonymized manually.</p>
                        <p>Because of this, since 2012, the lnCor Technology team has worked on a project to eliminate
                            this information in an automated way. According to Marco Antonio Gutierrez, IT Chief at
                            lnCor, medical equipment already records patient data as part of the image itself. "And this
                            is done without standardization. Information such as weight, height, age and birth date can
                            be found in different places in the image," he says.</p>
                        <p>Gutierrez also says the initial idea was to develop a robot to do the job. "Then, we created
                            a prototype to identify and blur sections with text information. That was our first effort
                            to solve this problem," says Gutierrez, highlighting that the model had to be improved, as
                            it blurred all text information.</p>
                        <p>"A lot of information, such as exam date and measurements, for example, needed to be kept. We
                            had the challenge of teaching our robot how to distinguish sensitive data from regular
                            data," he says. According to Gutierrez, in this first stage of the project in 2017, the
                            lnCor Technology team divided the process into three stages: text identification in imaging
                            exams, text conversion into a sequence of characters, and information blurring.</p>
                        <h2>Increased Processing Capacity and Use of Artificial Intelligence to Identify Sensitive
                            Information</h2>
                        <p>In 2017, the robot development project gained a new momentum. lnCor had built a partnership
                            with Intel, which identified Al as one of the areas of interest for the development of new
                            solutions. According to Gutierrez, the joint effort with Intel added one more stage to the
                            process: deploy a classifier through artificial intelligence.</p>
                        <p>"Al is used in a stage before we blur information, it identifies whether the information is
                            sensitive or not. For this reason, we've trained a neural network based on annotations done
                            by one person. After this training, the neural network identifies what is sensitive in the
                            text and blurs it, making it confidential," he explains.</p>
                        <p>In this project, Intel assigned a team of software experts who, since 2018, have provided
                            specialized resources to assist customers in their first Al-related developments. "We
                            analyzed how to use this type of resource to fulfill lncor's demands and identified the need
                            for data anonymization from imaging exams performed by the hospital, allowing their use in
                            large batches in research," explains Andre Ribeiro, New Business director at Intel Brazil.
                        </p>
                        <p>The first step was a pilot conducted in the last quarter of 2018, when Intel assigned
                            technicians with experience in Al solution development and lnCor assigned its own technical
                            team. "Together, we created this prototype for imaging exam anonymization. We're not only
                            talking about X-rays, but also magnetic resonance, tomography and other exams, each of them
                            performed in a different machine, from different manufacturers," adds Andre.</p>
                        <p>It means that each exam has different information placed on different parts of the image. In
                            practice, the Al system takes a number of different exams generated in different platforms
                            and submits them to a machine learning system, teaching the computer how to recognize what
                            data from that image can identify a person. Once these data are identified, this information
                            has to be blurred so that researchers cannot identify the patient.</p>

                        <p>In total, 680 images were used to train the algorithm, and later other 320 images were used
                            to test it, including different types of exams—some containing electrocardiographic tracing.
                            This group of 1,000 images comprised the first stage of algorithm training, and the results
                            were considered positive by the lnCor team.</p>
                        <p>"We achieved 100% accuracy in cineangiocardiography exams, about 60% in cardiovascular
                            ultrasound exams, and more than 50% in electro­cardiograms," reveals Gutierrez, highlighting
                            that, with humans, the margin of accuracy in identifying sensitive data is, in general, 85%.

                        <p>In addition to identifying sensitive data of patients, the system records all images in DICOM
                            (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) standard, ensuring information
                            compatibility between different devices.</p>
                        <p>With these results, lnCor is preparing to conduct in 2020 a new stage of neural network
                            training, now with a batch of 10,000 images. This new stage will also be supported by Intel.
                            "It's a medium­ and long-term work to be performed by lnCor with our support. In this second
                            stage, our role is to provide technical support and see how to make the algorithms more
                            efficient to run on the lnCor platform," explains Andre Ribeiro.</p>
                        <h5>Future Memory Capacity</h5>
                        <p>"Everything should be validated by the end of this year, resulting in process that will
                            scientifically prove the method of identifying information in exams," says Gutierrez,
                            emphasizing that the effort made so far is focused on research and development.</p>
                        <p>Now, the institution is focused on the scientific field, which would already produce
                            impressive results. Currently, lnCor conducts around 200,000 imaging exams every year, with
                            each exam containing one to thousands of images. "We have over one thousand research
                            projects running at the house. The subsets of these studies will certainly be used in these
                            projects," predicts Gutierrez.
