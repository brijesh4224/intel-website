                                            most expensive CPU or GPU. A holistic and balanced hardware setup is
                                            critical
                                            for an ideal user experience.</p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">A “balanced” PC is one in which the hardware is equipped for the
                                            workloads the machine will be handling, such as gaming, and should be
                                            designed
                                            to avoid “bottlenecks.” With a properly balanced PC, your components will
                                            achieve the level of performance they were designed for, without any one
                                            component (or set of components) being disproportionately over or
                                            under-utilized. This means a better gaming experience and a better user
                                            experience overall.</p>

                                                image you see onscreen. If the GPU is rendering these instructions
                                                faster than the CPU can provide them, the GPU will remain idle until the
                                                next set of instructions is ready.

                                            <p class="V_pv">This means the GPU is not operating at peak performance, and
                                                this can result in fewer frames per second being rendered. This is a
                                                bottleneck in that the performance level of the GPU is being restrained
                                                by the limitations of the CPU.

                                                the capabilities of the CPU are being limited by the slower speeds of
                                                the GPU. The system would perform better with a CPU and GPU that are

                                        <p class="V_pv">One of the advantages of pre-built PCs is that they are
                                            usually designed to be balanced. If you are building or upgrading your
                                            own system, however, you want to buy hardware that isn’t just compatible
                                            but complementary from a performance perspective.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="V_pv">Consider the best way to disperse your budget. You want the
                                            highest quality components, but you also want to prioritize for your
                                            needs. For example: If you want a higher resolution experience,
                                            allocating your budget to accommodate a higher resolution display and
                                            high-end graphics card is ideal. If you play fast-paced shooters like
                                            Call of Duty: Warzone or VALORANT, prioritizing a high frame rate with
                                            the <a href="#" class="V_andecor_r">right gaming CPU</a> and a higher
                                            refresh rate display makes sense.

                                        hardware you select, ensuring that it’s properly balanced will result in a
                                        better experience. When putting together your PC, keep in mind that you can
                                        always upgrade later. It’s preferable to have a balanced build you can upgrade
                                        rather than one very powerful component in a system that otherwise lags behind.

                                    <p class="V_pv">A balanced build goes beyond ensuring a better gaming experience.
                                        It’s about putting together a system that will perform at its best regardless of
                                        how you use it. Whether you’re gaming or creating, prioritizing balanced
                                        hardware will result in a better all-around experience.
