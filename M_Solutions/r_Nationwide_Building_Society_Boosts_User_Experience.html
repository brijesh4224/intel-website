                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">The Challenge</h2>
                        <p>Today’s retail banks are looking to streamline their Know Your Customer (KYC) process not
                            only to gain efficiencies but also improve regulatory compliance.</p>
                        <p>One of the biggest challenges banks and building societies face is the lack of
                            standardization across the industry. Different providers or divisions ask for inconsistent
                            documentation and information from account holders and applicants. This fragmentation leads
                            to client dissatisfaction, increased use of intermediaries, and increased cost of customer
                            retention.</p>
                        <p>Under pressure from leaner, more responsive neo banks, retail institutions are looking at
                            ways to effectively improve client experience to reduce account attrition.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">Typically, KYC is performed with the assistance of credit agencies who broker
                            customers’
                            personally identifiable information between financial organizations to limit the privacy,
                            confidentiality, reputational, and financial risks. This approach is both costly and
                            ineffective, adding an extra layer of bureaucracy and an over-reliance on manual processes,
                            making it cumbersome and time-consuming.</p>
                        <p>As a result, some financial institutions could struggle to comply with ever evolving
                            regulations in the KYC arena such as Anti Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing
                            legislations. Not only do new clients need to be screened but activities need to be reviewed
                            on a recurrent basis. Nationwide Building Society is working to achieve continuous,
                            sustainable compliance in the most cost-effective and expeditious manner.</p>
                        <p>As a data driven financial institution with a focus on machine intelligence, Nationwide is
                            constantly pursuing new initiatives to work with new technologies. Nationwide recognizes the
                            potential of insights in sensitive and restricted data and has launched multiple workstreams
                            to explore new technologies in this field, one of which is Confidential Computing.</p>
                        <p>Digitizing KYC through improved data sharing could also eliminate the need for customers to
                            visit a physical branch. Additionally, by building a system that shares confidential
                            customer data (with members permission), between financial institutions directly, Nationwide
                            was able to demonstrate accelerated KYC checks that could deliver a better service to
                            customers and gain efficiencies and cost savings on their current internal processes. There
                            would also be the potential to lower the cost of compliance checks by reducing reliance on
                            third-party credit agencies.</p>
                        <p>Nationwide accomplished this through Confidential Computing techniques that support machine
                            learning techniques and computation on third-party sensitive datasets. This provides a
                            solution for privacy and confidential challenges, assuring the integrity of the algorithms
                            using attestation techniques. This potentially opens the door to new ways of performing
                            initial and ongoing KYC checks.</p>

                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Confidential Computing and Nationwide</h2>
                        <p>As Nationwide embarked on a proof of concept to explore machine learning on encrypted
                            datasets, initial efforts focused on building a shared database using homomorphic
                            encryption. The proof-of-concept encrypted database worked as expected. However, the
                            performance of the queries when working with production data and real-world customer
                            journeys became a concern.</p>
                        <p>Nationwide refocused the Proof of Concept to the potential offered by Confidential Computing
                            powered by <a href="">Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX)</a> technology available
                            in the Intel®
                            <a href=""> Xeon® E family of</a> processors. Intel SGX offers hardware-based memory
                            encryption that
                            isolates specific application code and data in memory. Intel SGX allows user-level code to
                            allocate private regions of memory, called enclaves, which are designed to be protected from
                            processes running at higher privilege levels.
                        </p>
                        <p>A proof of concept built on Intel SGX was developed that allowed encrypted datasets to be
                            decrypted safely inside of an enclave. This alternative technology approach offered far
                            better scalability than the homomorphic encryption approach. Although the Intel Xeon E
                            family of processors has a relatively small enclave size requiring the application to swap
                            in and out of the enclave, Intel SGX was quick and responsive, while data was fully
                            encrypted to maintain confidentiality of the “shared” datasets. During testing, it was shown
                            that partners were able to inspect the various functions inside the SGX enclave and confirm
                            access was properly protected—but that the raw data itself remained encrypted and
                            inaccessible to other partners sharing information via the platform.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Closing Remarks</h2>
                        <p>The KYC Proof of Concept has served as a launchpad for Confidential Computing powered by
                            Intel SGX within Nationwide. It has helped to clarify the potential of secure enclaves, and
                            how they can be used to create more secure data sharing opportunities with third parties.
                            There is also a clear case for using Intel SGX-protected data sharing to help detect and
                            reduce fraud like Anti Money Laundering for example. Similarly, data shared in the
                            Confidential Computing enclave may be used to build more accurate profiles for each
                            customer, allowing Nationwide to tailor offers and promotions or to use deeper, more
                            accurate insights to develop new products and services.</p>
                        <p>During the project, the Software Engineering Proof of Concepts team built a collection of
                            code libraries that utilize SGX. These are now being made available to other in-house
                            development teams to be integrated into other projects quickly and easily, whenever they are
                            needed providing the potential for newer value-added services for Nationwide.</p>
                        <p>SGX technology continues to mature and adapt to the changing needs of industry. With the
                            release of the new 3rd Generation family of Intel® Xeon® processors, there are even more
                            potential opportunities.</p>

                                Generation Intel Xeon Scalable systems from Intel are really interesting to us from a
                                proof-of-concept perspective. Something we realized on the earlier silicon was that
                                there were concerns about how it would perform at scale, due to the need to shift data
                                in and out of the enclaves because of their limited size. This meant Throttling that
                                size up to 1 terabyte on this new generation of processor has the potential to address
                                those concerns, as well as opening up some exciting new use cases that we want to talk
                                to the business about.”—Andy Hodgson, Head of Software Engineering Proof of Concepts at

                        <p>With stakeholder buy-in, Intel SGX has the potential to radically change the way that the
                            financial sector accesses and shares data about customers. With end-to-end encryption and
                            robust confidentiality, banks can begin to build services that help them to meet their
                            compliance obligations without degrading the customer experience.</p>
