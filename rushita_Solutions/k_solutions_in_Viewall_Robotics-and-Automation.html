                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4" id="key1">Transforming Manufacturing and Warehousing with Robotics</h3>
                        <p>For industrial manufacturers and warehousing businesses, gaining an edge on their always-evolving competitive landscape is becoming increasingly more difficult.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_bluehover1">Consumer spending is on the rise, creating higher demand on staff already spread thin. The United States saw <a href="#">Q2 2021 personal consumption expenditures increase 11.9 percent on top of an 11.4 percent increase the previous quarter</a>.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;And at the same time, the industrial sector is facing a large labor gap. <a href="#">According to a May 2021 report by Deloitte and The Manufacturing Institute</a>,&nbsp;77 percent of more than 800 US manufacturers surveyed anticipate having trouble recruiting and retaining employees in 2021 and beyond.<sup>2</sup></p>
                        <p>Combine these two factors with rapidly changing technology and competitors that are constantly innovating, and you have a perfect storm for industrial businesses.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Many companies are now turning to industrial automation and robotics not only as a solution to these challenges but as a way to get ahead and stay ahead in their market. But what is automation, how does it help solve today’s challenges, and where do robots fit in?</p>
                        <h4 class="mt-5">What Is Warehouse Automation?</h4>
                        <p>Warehouse automation is the process of using technology, such as robots, to make processes more efficient with minimal assistance from human workers.</p>
                        <p>Until recently, warehouse automation was completed with automated guided vehicles (AGVs), which rely on predefined paths and human operators to complete tasks such as materials delivery. The exponential growth of e-commerce and increasing demand for flexible technology have exposed the limitations of AGVs.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_bluehover1">Today, warehouse automation can be performed by <a href="#">autonomous mobile robots (AMRs)</a> that navigate warehouses independently and assist human workers. Industrial robotic arms are also a common automation technology that’s used for picking, placing, and sorting objects. Both of these technologies are critical to order fulfillment in e-commerce.</p>
                        <p>Both AMRs and robotic arms can be augmented with vision sensors (such as 2D/3D cameras) and empowered with artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to deliver enhanced operations and support innovative processes. Vision- and AI-enabled robots can “see”, which enables them to detect, classify, sort, pick and package objects. They often operate with better accuracy and consistency than human operators, making them less prone to errors or accidents.</p>
                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">What Is Automated Manufacturing?</h3>
                        <p>Just as robots are critical to enabling warehouse automation, they are also essential for bringing automation to factories.</p>
                        <p>Automated manufacturing uses technology to make production processes more efficient. This results in higher outputs at lower costs for manufacturers.</p>
                        <p>While robots have been used in manufacturing for decades, the recent introduction of AI is revolutionizing how business gets done. AI enables robots to&nbsp;perform their tasks better&nbsp;and take on additional ones. For example, robots can now inspect parts as they build them to detect issues in real-time and improve overall product or process quality and yield. AI-powered robotic arms improve safety in some industrial sectors by completing complex tasks in dangerous environments where human workers would risk injuries or serious harm. AI also&nbsp;makes it easier to retrain and reteach robots when repurposing them for different tasks. This can lower the cost of operations and keep human workers focused on more complex, higher value assignments.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Because robots are versatile, they can be used throughout the manufacturing facility or assembly line for tasks such as welding, painting, cutting, and in-line inspection. Additionally, they often work alongside humans to protect them from mundane, stressful, or harmful aspects of the manufacturing process, including lifting, moving, or holding heavy items.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">How to Achieve Warehouse Automation and Automated Manufacturing</h3>
                        <p>Before industrial businesses can reap the full benefits of robotic-enabled automation on the factory floor or in the warehouse, they need the ability to capture, aggregate, and analyze data and information from multiple sensors, applications, and processes closer to the source.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_bluehover1">This can be achieved through <a href="#">IT/OT convergence</a>,&nbsp;which is the integration of information technology (IT), the hardware and software that process data, with operational technology (OT), the systems that control industrial operations. This consolidation creates a responsive, interconnected platform that enables businesses to adjust operational systems in near-real time—which helps reduce downtime, automate processes, and inform new, innovative solutions.</p>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_bluehover1">With these new converged systems, businesses can integrate innovative, <a href="#">intelligent industrial edge solutions and capabilities</a>&nbsp;that can further reduce costs and increase profits. This includes: <a href="#">AMRs powered by artificial intelligence (AI)</a>&nbsp;that help automate manufacturing and logistics to boost efficiency; industrial robotic arms equipped with machine vision to check for product defects, read bar codes, and confirm correct label position on products; or collaborative robots (cobots) with integrated sensors to safely help human workers with material handling.</p>


                        <h3 class="fw-lighter mt-5 pt-4">Benefits of Robotics in Warehouses and Manufacturing</h3>
                        <p>Once companies achieve IT/OT convergence, companies can effectively use robotics to automate processes and realize several other benefits:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Higher efficiency and productivity.</strong> Robots can perform a variety of tasks, including those that are complex, niche, and highly repetitive and variable, without the need to rest or take breaks. This allows production, safety inspections, or other tasks to be performed in perpetuity to increase output.</li>
                            <li><strong>Improved product quality.</strong> For tasks that require extreme precision, businesses can benefit from the innate precision, consistency, and accuracy offered by robotic arms. Robots equipped with cameras and empowered by AI help improve product quality by performing real-time inspections on assembly lines and reducing the need for rework.</li>
                            <li><strong>Improved worker safety and workplace ergonomics.</strong> Tasks that require access to hazardous environments, demand highly repetitive and strenuous movements, or involve handling dangerous chemicals or substances can drastically increase the risk of human workers getting injured. By using robots in such scenarios, businesses can keep workers out of harm’s way and prevent possible injuries.</li>
                            <li><strong>Increased cost savings.</strong> Through improved efficiency and quality control, reduced waste, and less downtime, the use of robots for automation can translate into cost savings for businesses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reduced waste.</strong> When programmed properly, robots can complete delicate tasks within extremely tight tolerance limits. The lack of variation in product manufacturing can help eliminate defects, scrap parts, the need for rework, and—ultimately—waste.</li>
                            <li><strong>Faster cycle times.</strong> One of the most common reasons manufacturers integrate robots into operations is to reduce manufacturing cycle times. They turn to robots because of their ability to operate at speeds faster than human workers, reliability to complete tasks without breaks, and operational precision—all of which can help optimize cycle times.</li>
                        </ul>
