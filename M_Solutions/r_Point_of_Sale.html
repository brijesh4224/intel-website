                                <p>Future-focused retail stores, restaurants, and hospitability companies are embracing
                                    a new generation of POS technology that makes it easier than ever for customers to
                                    find and buy what they want and provides businesses with new opportunities for
                                    efficiency, growth, and success.</p>
                                <p>These new retail POS systems are powerful tools that come in a variety of form
                                    factors and can integrate with <a href="">computer vision, artificial intelligence,
                                        edge
                                        computing, IoT sensors</a>, and other emerging technologies to give businesses
                                    unprecedented insight into the changing customer journey.</p>
                                <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Point of Sale (POS) Technology</h2>
                                <p>As the retail, food services, and hospitality industries have evolved over the last
                                    few decades, so too has POS technology. Stationary terminals—operated by
                                    employees—are the original and most common type of POS system. Self-checkout kiosks
                                    put customers in control of their transactions by incorporating POS systems with the
                                    latest AI, IoT, and edge computing technologies. Multidevice systems, which comprise
                                    desktop, mobile, all in one (AIO), and self-service POS solutions, are also rising
                                    in popularity because they can be scaled up as customer traffic demands.</p>
                                <p>To determine your ideal retail POS solution, familiarize yourself with each form
                                    factor and its benefits. You should also consider which system will best support
                                    your business activities, align with your staffing levels, and provide the <a
                                        href="">shopping
                                        experience your customers want</a>.</p>
                                <h4 class="fw-lighter" style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Desktop POS</h4>
                                <p>Desktop POS solutions are the tried-and-true traditional POS systems relied on since
                                    the 1980s. They are operated by employees and run on a PC or laptop to enable one
                                    central location to handle all transaction tasks. They connect to other POS devices,
                                    such as barcode scanners, credit card readers, and cash drawers.</p>
                                <p>Businesses can extend the value of their desktop POS solution by integrating with
                                    other apps and technologies to uncover actionable insights for marketing or
                                    accounting purposes.</p>
                                <h4 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">All-in-One (AIO) POS</h4>
                                <p>All-in-one POS systems are a subset of desktop POS systems and also date back to the
                                    1980s. They incorporate PCs with touchscreen monitors to provide businesses with a
                                    sleek, modern terminal that can handle all transactions without the need for
                                    peripherals, such as printers and credit card machines. They are straightforward, so
                                    staff can begin using them immediately with minimal training. Many businesses also
                                    enjoy using AIO POS systems because of their small footprint. When occupied space
                                    takes away from new sales opportunities, a smaller POS system is ideal.</p>
                                <h4 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Mobile POS</h4>
                                <p>One of the most popular types of POS solutions is the mobile POS (mPOS). Introduced
                                    in the 2000s, mPOS systems use tablets or other handheld devices to complete
                                    customer transactions. They are often carried by retail or restaurant employees for
                                    fast, ultraconvenient customer service. mPOS systems have a low up-front investment
                                    cost, making them accessible to smaller or startup businesses. To stand out from the
                                    competition, many businesses are now integrating their mPOS systems with edge
                                    computing solutions and technologies to gain near-real-time insights about their
                                    customers.</p>

                                <h4 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Self-Checkout and Contactless POS</h4>
                                <p>Despite the first self-checkout POS systems being placed in a Kroger store in
                                    Atlanta, Georgia, in 1986,1 they weren’t widely accepted until the mid-2010s, when
                                    more than 63,000 units were shipped worldwide.2 Since then, their use has only
                                    increased. Today, self-checkout POS terminals are the dominant grocery checkout
                                    format, accounting for 55 percent of transactions in 2022.3 These systems need
                                    minimal staff intervention because most—if not all—transaction steps are completed
                                    by customers in grocery stores, <a href="">quick-service restaurants</a>, banks, and
                                    hotels.</p>
                                <p>A subset of self-checkout POS solutions that’s gaining traction among businesses and
                                    customers is the <a href="">self-service kiosk station</a>. These POS systems
                                    typically serve one
                                    specific business need, such as selling a movie theater ticket, allowing customers
                                    to check in-store inventory, or providing and processing parking garage tickets.</p>
                                <p>Recently, businesses have started integrating self-checkout POS systems with IoT
                                    technologies, such as cameras powered by AI, to add new capabilities like computer
                                    vision to their systems. With computer vision, self-checkout systems can become
                                    contactless, removing physical contact between shoppers and staff while the
                                    technology confirms that the products being scanned match those items in the virtual
                                    basket to help ensure accuracy, reduce theft, and better manage inventory.</p>
                                <p>In 2020, many businesses starting implementing popular contactless POS technologies,
                                    such as mobile wallets and near-field communication (NFC)‒enabled payments, where
                                    customers scanned their phone or hovered a card over a payment terminal to finish
                                    their purchase, to meet increased health and hygiene measures during the pandemic.
                                    Contactless self-checkout POS systems are still being used today by businesses
                                    looking for new ways to create engaging, ultraconvenient experiences for customers.4

                                <h2 class="fw-lighter" style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Retail POS Features and Benefits</h2>
                                <p>It’s also important to explore the most common features included across form factors
                                    and assess which best align with your business needs and can provide a
                                    differentiated customer shopping experience.</p>
                                <h4 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Payment Processing</h4>
                                <p>Payment processing is a crucial POS system feature. While payment processing used to
                                    be as simple as accepting cash or a check for your products or services, today’s
                                    modern POS technology provides you and your customers with many more-convenient,
                                    frictionless payment processing options.</p>
                                <p>One important point to remember is that POS solutions are not payment processors.
                                    However, payment processing is often a feature bundled as part of a POS technology
                                    package. If payment processing is not included in your POS system, there are
                                    hundreds of third-party processing companies available to act as your payment
                                    processor for credit or debit card transactions.</p>
                                <h4 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Inventory Management</h4>
                                <p>Having accurate and near-real-time inventory management has never been more important
                                    for businesses. Poor inventory management and stockouts can drastically hurt your
                                    bottom line. Aside from the lost revenue from the sale, recent research reveals 21
                                    percent of consumers who experience stockouts will take their business elsewhere5 to
                                    find the product or brand they want.</p>
                                <p>Luckily, modern retail POS technology can help you keep products in stock. Businesses
                                    can now integrate edge-to-cloud solutions with their POS solution to collect and
                                    process data and then apply AI and machine learning to uncover key insights to
                                    streamline processes, automate forecasting, and improve efficiency.</p>
                                <h4 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Customer Purchase History</h4>
                                <p>Every time a customer purchases from your business—whether that’s through an
                                    e-commerce platform, in store, via a mobile app, or other digital touchpoints in
                                    your <a href="">omnichannel retail strategy</a>—that transaction data is captured in
                                    your POS
                                    solution and waiting to be harnessed. Analyzing that data helps you better
                                    understand your customers so you can enhance their future shopping experience,
                                    personalize communications, and identify opportunities to offer near-perfect product
                                    recommendations. In turn, your customers connect with the products they want at the
                                    right time and in the way they prefer, building their brand loyalty and creating a
                                    smarter, more profitable business for you.</p>
                                <h4 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Real-Time Sales Data</h4>
                                <p>Collecting, processing, and analyzing POS data in near-real time can be a great way
                                    for retailers to enhance customer experiences, better manage inventory, mitigate
                                    product loss, and make more-informed data-driven decisions to move business forward.
                                    For example, <a href="">Rotkäppchen-Mumm</a>, a wine business in Germany, runs
                                    real-time dynamic
                                    promotional content on digital signs throughout the store. Because the sign content
                                    syncs with POS sales data and <a href="">retail analytics</a>, if a specific product
                                    is out of
                                    stock or in low inventory, it won’t be advertised on screen.</p>
                                <h2 class="fw-lighter" style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">The Future of POS Systems</h2>
                                <p>POS technology has come a long way, from serving as a simple way to complete
                                    transactions to being an integral tool to better understand and connect with
                                    customers.</p>
                                <p>As retailers continue to blend online and in-store shopping experiences and move to
                                    an omnichannel approach, exploring and embracing emerging POS technology will be
                                    critical. Start your exploration by looking at the next-generation POS technologies
                                    that will allow you to provide customers with innovative and exciting experiences
                                    they didn’t even know they wanted.</p>
                                <h4 style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Frictionless POS</h4>
                                <p>Leading retailers are already implementing the next evolution of POS
                                    solutions—frictionless self-checkout POS. These POS systems use technologies like
                                    computer vision, AI, deep learning, edge-enabled sensors, and other emerging
                                    solutions to streamline the customer buying experience. For example, <a
                                        href="">Nourish + Bloom
                                        grocery in Fayetteville, Georgia</a>, allows customers to shop with no checkout
                                    lines
                                    and no cashiers. To shop, customers simply download the store’s app, scan your phone
                                    when entering the store, load groceries into their cart, and walk out—a truly
                                    frictionless, contactless shopping experience.</p>
                                <p>Frictionless self-checkout POS technology can also be used in airports, cafeterias,
                                    or food service businesses for <a href="">plated and nonbarcoded items</a>. These
                                    solutions give
                                    customers more control and streamline their checkout experience while helping to
                                    augment staff resources for businesses facing rising labor shortages and costs.</p>
