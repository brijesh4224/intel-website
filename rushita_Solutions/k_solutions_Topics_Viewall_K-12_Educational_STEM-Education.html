                        <h2 class="k_26px mt-5 fw-lighter pt-4">What Is STEM Education?</h2>
                        <p>Since the 1990s, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education—also known as STEAM with the addition of the arts—has become an essential building block for student success. STEM education has been shown to provide a variety of educational benefits, such as improving critical thinking, student engagement, problem solving, and collaboration. STEM education can also help students thrive in the future workforce as they apply what they’ve learned in the real world.</p>
                        <p>While STEM education isn’t a new concept, schools are changing how they incorporate it into their digital strategies and curricula. Because students are already surrounded by technology every day, educators are focused on integrating STEM principles into a wide range of hands-on, engaging student activities to maximize learning outcomes.</p>
                        <h3>Developing Innovative Skill Sets and Mindsets Through STEM</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">A technology-supported, skills-based curriculum helps students develop <a href="">analytical skill sets and mindsets</a>&nbsp;that prepare them to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing world and take on the jobs of the future.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Skill sets</strong> refer to how students carry out tasks to solve specific problems. Simulation, data science, and programming are all examples of STEM skill sets.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mindsets</strong> refer to the unique lens through which students navigate the world and approach problems. Social-emotional competencies, design thinking, and computational thinking are common mindsets.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Students can develop valuable skill sets and mindsets through STEM programming. For example, suppose students are tasked with measuring the impact of wind and soil erosion on farmlands. In that case, they might use a design thinking mindset to decide how to identify correlations between weather and land characteristics, then use data science and simulation skills to complete their evaluation.</p>
                        <h3>The Importance of STEM Education for the Future Workforce</h3>
                        <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">In the past, STEM education aimed to prepare students for scientific and technical jobs. Today, as we work and live during the <a href="">Fourth Industrial Revolution</a> which converges physical and digital systems and increases human-machine interaction—STEM education not only prepares students for jobs in tech, but in virtually every industry.<br>
                            With the rise of generative AI solutions, marketing, design, development, and customer service jobs are rapidly evolving to integrate AI tools. Huge volumes of data are generated every year across industries through the use of connected, AI-enabled, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, creating a growing need for dedicated data analysts and data scientists and strong analytic skills within traditional job functions. The growth of the video gaming industry is creating even more demand for programmers, 3D artists, and visual effects producers who can blend technical skills with creative storytelling.</p>
                            <p>STEM education is more critical than ever as students prepare to enter the workforce, no matter what career path they choose to pursue.</p>
                            <h3>Engaging Underrepresented Groups in STEM</h3>
                            <p class="k_plink1 k_intext1blue1">A strong foundation in STEM can empower young people with the skills and confidence they need to change the world. <a href="
